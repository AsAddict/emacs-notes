  I know you'll be very pleased to learn that I am typing
   this letter to you on Emacs. I can't claim any great degree of
   expertise with it. In fact, I am still fumbling around with the
   navigation and editing shortcuts. But I suppose this is a start. I
   should get around to various plugins and eventually planner pretty
   soon.
