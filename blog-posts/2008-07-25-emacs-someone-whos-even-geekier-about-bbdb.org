Remember all those tweaks I posted for
[[http://sachachua.com/wp/category/bbdb][working with contacts using
Emacs' Big Brother Database]]? John Sturdy has even cooler stuff. Check
out his
[[http://www.cb1.com/~john/computing/emacs/lisp/my-extensions-to-packages/bbdb/index.html][BBDB
extensions]]. His
[[http://www.cb1.com/~john/computing/emacs/lisp/my-extensions-to-packages/bbdb/bbdb-export-lists.el][bbdb-export-lists.el]]
can divide people into different phone and address lists, and his
[[http://www.cb1.com/~john/computing/emacs/lisp/my-extensions-to-packages/bbdb/bbdb-human-names.el][bbdb-human-names.el]]
will even try to address people properly. Clearly, I don't talk to
enough Reverend Doctors to require code like this. (And shouldn't there
be “Right Honorables” and “His Grace”s in there, too? ;) )
