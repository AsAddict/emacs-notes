Thanks to [[http://www.lifl.fr/~hodique/][Yann Hodique]]â€˜s totally
awesome
 backend structure in
[[mailto:hodique@lifl.fr][hodique@lifl.fr]]---test/planner---merge---1.0,
the distinction between planner/emacs-wiki and planner/muse is on the
way to disappearing. Yann's Elisp-fu is far beyond mine, and it shows in
the elegance and cleanliness of the backend code.

It's much, much better than my kludgy attempts when I wrote the first
 port of Planner to Muse. I kept running into problems thinking of an
 elegant way to combine both backends. I just wanted to get Planner out
 the door, so I tagged a new branch and replaced all the emacs-wiki
 code with muse equivalents.

That spurred a lot of development on the planner-muse front, and we
 blessed Michael Olson's tree as the canonical planner-muse branch.
 Keeping up with patches became a real headache, though, because of all
 the translation between branches.

I've tagged a new tree off Yann Hodique's branch and made emacs-wiki
 work again. I've also brought it up to the latest dev (I think!), and
 I'll be using it for the next few weeks. A number of modules still
 require emacs-wiki, and with the Planner community's help, we hope to
 open them up to Muse people as well!

You can grab the merged tree with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    tla register-archive http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/arch
    tla get sacha@free.net.ph--main/planner--merge--1.0 planner
#+END_EXAMPLE

Back up your plans and customize planner-backend. Have fun!
