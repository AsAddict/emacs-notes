#+TITLE: Should emacs-wiki links be easily editable?

With the recent addition of `emacs-wiki-link-escape' and
 `emacs-wiki-link-unescape', links are now unescaped before displaying.
 This makes them uneditable. People probably shouldn't be editing the
 links manually as this can screw up planner links (among others), but
 I should provide an easy way to edit the link at point. I have a
 function in my emacs-wiki-config.el to do that. I'll probably bind to
 C-c C-e, which makes sense.
