#+TITLE: Okay, we're in business -- 5 years of my life in WordPress

After a fair bit of Emacs hacking to export all my blog entries from
Planner into RSS and then import that into WordPress using
Feedwordpress, I'm happy to present this
[[http://sachachua.com/wp/][WordPress view]] of my blog. It should stay
relatively in-sync with my Emacs blog. Emacs still gives me a friendlier
and more powerful interface for blogging, but at least this way you get
to use all the fancy stuff for reading blog entries. =)

Random Emacs symbol: internal-set-alternative-font-registry-alist --
Function: Define alternative font registries to try in face font
selection.
