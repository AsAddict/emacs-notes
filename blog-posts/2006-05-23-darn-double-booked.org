This is what I get for not religiously putting everything into my
 Planner. Elie Wiesel's talk is right after my Toronto Coranto
 performance at Emmanuel College. I'll probably end up hanging out with
 the other renaissance dancers and my friends instead of running over
 to the auditorium to catch not even a live performance but an
 audio/visual feed from another room. It's a $15 lesson which I'll be
 sure to remember. Then again, I can think of it as my donation to
 social philosophy...

Let me see if I can give this ticket away, as it's Really Unlikely
 that I'll get to refund it.
