I'm up to here with things to do
 And buried under data
 The notes I keep all filed away,
 The tasks---I'll do them later.

>

+1 to put things off a day,
 Tomorrow: work 'til all is done,
 Today I can relax---but then
 Tomorrow'll never come.

>

My webpage looks impressive, sure,
 But check a few days later.
 The same tasks appear. I know,
 I'm such a procrastinator.
