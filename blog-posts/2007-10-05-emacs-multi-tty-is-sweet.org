The multiple-terminal support in Emacs 23 (CVS) means that I can leave
 my main Emacs session running on my laptop, connect to it from the
 desktop using SSH, get a graphical display on a big screen, and still
 be able to use my laptop if I decide to go off wireless. It also
 allows me to fake having a dual-screen Emacs setup. =) Very happy.
 This will be good for when I'm writing
[[http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/WickedCoolEmacs][WickedCoolEmacs]],
too.

I used the great scripts from
[[http://www.enigmacurry.com/2007/05/24/multi-tty-emacs-on-gentoo-and-ubuntu/][Enigma
Curry: Multi-tty Emacs on Gentoo and Ubuntu]] to make it painless.

Random Emacs symbol: pcomplete/eshell-mode/eshell-debug -- Function:
Completion for the `debug' command.
