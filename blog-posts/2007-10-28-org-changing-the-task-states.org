#+TITLE: Org: Changing the task states

I find it useful to keep track of which tasks I've started. Adding the
 following line to the start of my Org file adds STARTED to my to-do
 status keywords.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) STARTED(s) WAITING(w) | DONE(d)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here's some code to make it easier to clock in and out of tasks:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun sacha/org-clock-in-if-starting ()
      "Clock in when the task is marked STARTED."
      (when (and (string= state "STARTED")
                 (not (string= last-state state)))
        (org-clock-in)))
    (add-hook 'org-after-todo-state-change-hook
          'sacha/org-clock-in-if-starting)
    (defadvice org-clock-in (after sacha activate)
      "Set this task's status to 'STARTED'."
      (org-todo "STARTED"))
#+END_EXAMPLE
