Guide to Emacs]]

Dired is the Emacs directory editor. You can get to it with C-x C-f
(=find-file=) if you specify a directory. C-x d (=dired=) works too.
Dired makes it easy to do batch operations on files. One of the niftiest
features that you might not even think of looking for, though, is the
ability to make a Dired buffer editable using C-x C-q
(=dired-toggle-read-only=). Then you can use =replace-regexp=, keyboard
macros, and all sorts of other ways to change filenames. When you switch
back out of editing mode with C-x C-q, the files will be updated.

Here's a cheat sheet for working with Dired.

Also, bjonnh suggested making a cheat sheet for movement commands. I use
the M-b, M-f, C-M-b, and C-M-f shortcuts a lot when working with Emacs
Lisp. C-a and C-e are great too.

If you use =evil-mode= because you're used to Vim shortcuts, this cheat
sheet won't be useful to you, but maybe I can make an evil-mode cheat
sheet someday.

In other news, I'm slowly becoming the kind of person who can understand
SmartParens. I'm getting the hang of slurp and barf, but the rest of it
still boggles me. Someday!
