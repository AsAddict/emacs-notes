[[http://www.douglasjohnston.net][Douglas Johnston]] invited me to join
him on the [[http://www.diyplanner.com][D.I.Y. Planner]] site. He
totally, totally rocks. I'll learn much more and help many more as part
of something like that than on my own, and it's an awesome opportunity
to learn from others. =) I'm putting drafts of organizer-related
articles up on plannerlove.com for now, but I'm working on something
else for the site on my computer. Instead of striking it out on my own
as a productivity blogger, I'm going to make plannerlove.com a fantastic
resource for all of you planner-el fans out there... =)
