Global planner IDs should be hyperlinks in their own right. They are of
the form

plan://id-number or
 plan://id-number/page,page,page,page

But then how do we define anchors and references?

Reference: plan:///id-number or plan:///id-number/page,page,page,page
(note: triple-slashes)

Or maybe =plan:id-number[/page,page,page]= for the anchor.
Double-slashes will not be updated.

I want IDs because I'd like to e able to update notes in case of
 typos.

Then this is no longer emacs-wiki-id, but really just planner-id.

Yikes, I will so break the existing planner-id support with
 this... There must be a better way. At the very least, I should offer
 a conversion function.
