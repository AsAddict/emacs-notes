After philosophy class ended, a number of my classmates asked me to
 send my notes to them. Apparently, the fact that I get
 near-transcriptions of Fr. David's speeches (verbatim if I'm not
 distracted and he pauses often). I am surprised to see that my notes
 have reached 256K. I sent them a URL to my planner-managed site at

of course.
