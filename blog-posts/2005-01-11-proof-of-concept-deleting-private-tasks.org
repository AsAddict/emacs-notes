It's easy to tweak Planner. For example, the following two lines of
 code delete all lines that contain {{private}} before publishing. Your
 planner pages will be fine, but the published HTML won't contain them.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (add-to-list 'planner-publishing-markup (lambda () (delete-matching-lines "{{private}}")))
    (planner-update-wiki-project)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Fun, isn't it?
