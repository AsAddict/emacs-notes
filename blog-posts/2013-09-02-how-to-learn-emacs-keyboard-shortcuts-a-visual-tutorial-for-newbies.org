This entry is part 2 of 4 in the series
[[http://sachachua.com/blog/series/a-visual-guide-to-emacs/][A Visual Guide to Emacs]]

Emacs keyboard shortcuts often mystify beginners because they're not the
same as the shortcuts for other applications (C-w instead of C-x for
cutting text, etc.), and they're long (what do you mean, C-x 5 f?!). I
hope this guide will help break down the learning process for you so
that you can pick up the keyboard shortcuts step by step. It's under the

This is actually my second version of the guide. In the first one, I got
a little sidetracked because I wanted to address common frustrations
that get in people's way. Here's the *Grumpy Guide to Learning Emacs
Keyboard Shortcuts*:
