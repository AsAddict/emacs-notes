I want to collect all of my notes about people into wiki pages about
 them so that I can easily see timestamps. I will also need to
 cross-reference. In the meantime, I can keep this information in my
 daily notes.

Issues:

- Privacy? I'd like some things public and some things encrypted.
 - planner-bbdb-remember dependencies. I think I'll need the
condition-case idiom.
