2Many professionals bill clients for their time. Even if you don't,
keeping track of the time you actually spend on tasks can help you
improve your time estimates and check if you're spending enough time on
the things that are important to you. For example, keeping track of the
time you spend on tasks might show you that you spend two and a half
hours each day just responding to e-mail. If you can identify problem
areas like that, then you can look for more effective ways to perform
the tasks that take up a lot of your time.
</p>

<p>
I love Org's timeclocking support, and I think you will too. Because
it's integrated with your task list, you don't have to switch to
separate application or reenter data. You can get more detailed time
reports, too. All you have to do is remember to clock in before you
start a task and clock out when you finish it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Starting and stopping the clock</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
You can clock in by moving your cursor to the task headline in either
your organizer.org file or the org agenda view, and then pressing C-c
C-x C-i (org-agenda-clock-in or org-clock-in, depending on context).
This adds the time stamp to the task. If you are already clocked into
another task in that organizer file, you'll be clocked out of it to
prevent you from accidentally double-billing.
</p>

<p>
To clock out of a task, type C-c C-x C-o from the task headline. Marking
a task as done will also automatically stop the clock, if that was the
task with the active clock.
</p>

<p>
Here's some code to make this even easier. The following code clocks in
whenever you market task is started, and clocks out when you market a
task as WAITING. It also automatically market task is started if you
clock in. This takes advantage of the Org configuration previously
suggested in the Setup section. Add this to your ~/.emacs and evaluate
it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">eval-after-load</span> 'org
  '(<span class="org-keyword">progn</span>
     (<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">wicked/org-clock-in-if-starting</span> ()
       <span class="org-doc">"Clock in when the task is marked STARTED."</span>
       (<span class="org-keyword">when</span> (and (string= state <span class="org-string">"STARTED"</span>)
          (not (string= last-state state)))
     (org-clock-in)))
     (add-hook 'org-after-todo-state-change-hook
           'wicked/org-clock-in-if-starting)
     (<span class="org-keyword">defadvice</span> <span class="org-function-name">org-clock-in</span> (after wicked activate)
      <span class="org-doc">"Set this task's status to 'STARTED'."</span>
      (org-todo <span class="org-string">"STARTED"</span>))
    (<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">wicked/org-clock-out-if-waiting</span> ()
      <span class="org-doc">"Clock out when the task is marked WAITING."</span>
      (<span class="org-keyword">when</span> (and (string= state <span class="org-string">"WAITING"</span>)
                 (equal (marker-buffer org-clock-marker) (current-buffer))
                 (&lt; (point) org-clock-marker)
             (&gt; (<span class="org-keyword">save-excursion</span> (outline-next-heading) (point))
            org-clock-marker)
         (not (string= last-state state)))
    (org-clock-out)))
    (add-hook 'org-after-todo-state-change-hook
          'wicked/org-clock-out-if-waiting)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
What if you forgot to clock into a task when you started? No problem.
Simply clock in and out of it, then edit the starting timestamp for the
task in your ~/organizer.org file. To find a starting timestamp, move
your cursor to the task headline. If the task has been collapsed to a
single line, press TAB to expand it. Look for a line that starts with
</p>
<p>
collapsed segment, he expanded by moving a cursor to it and pressing
tab. Find the clock entry you want to change, and if the timestamp, and
press C-c C-y (org-evaluate-time-range) to update the time total.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Reporting time</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
</div><div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">By project</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
To see how much time you've spent on a project or task, open your
~/organizer.org file and press C-c C-x C-d (org-clock-display). Total
times will be added to each headline, summarizing the times for each
subtree.
</p>

<p>
You can also use one of Org's dynamic blocks. Open your ~/organizer.org
file, move your cursor to where you want the report inserted, and type
C-c C-x C-r (org-clock-report). By default, the reports will include all
the second-level headings for all the days.
</p>

<p>
What if you want to limit the report to just the time you clocked last
week?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Reporting time for a period</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
To summarize it for a span of days, change the starting line from:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-meta-line">#+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :emphasize nil</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
to something like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-meta-line">#+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :emphasize nil :tstart "&lt;2007-12-25 Sun&gt;" :tend "&lt;2007-12-31 Mon&gt;"</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
where tstart is the starting time/date and tend is the ending time/date.
You can add the timestamps either manually or with C-c C-.
(org-time-stamp). After you change the block definition, update the
clock table by typing C-c C-x C-u (org-dblock-update).
</p>

<p>
You can also use a definition like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-meta-line">#+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :emphasize nil :block today</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
to see today's entries. Other block keywords are ‘yesterday',
‘thisweek', ‘lastweek', ‘thismonth', ‘lastmonth', ‘thisyear', or
‘lastyear'.
</p>

<p>
If you need more levels of headings, change the value of maxlevel. For
example, to see a detailed clock table with up to 10 levels of headings,
use
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-org"><span class="org-org-meta-line">#+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 10 :emphasize nil :block today</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
clocktable summarizes the reported time. What if you want the time
broken down by day?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Reporting time by days</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
The following code creates a custom dynamic block that breaks the
reported time by date. Add the following code to your ~/.emacs:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">org-dblock-write:rangereport</span> (params)
  <span class="org-doc">"Display day-by-day time reports."</span>
  (<span class="org-keyword">let*</span> ((ts (plist-get params <span class="org-builtin">:tstart</span>))
         (te (plist-get params <span class="org-builtin">:tend</span>))
         (start (time-to-seconds
                 (apply 'encode-time (org-parse-time-string ts))))
         (end (time-to-seconds
               (apply 'encode-time (org-parse-time-string te))))
         day-numbers)
    (setq params (plist-put params <span class="org-builtin">:tstart</span> nil))
    (setq params (plist-put params <span class="org-builtin">:end</span> nil))
    (<span class="org-keyword">while</span> (&lt;= start end)
      (<span class="org-keyword">save-excursion</span>
        (insert <span class="org-string">"\n\n"</span>
                (format-time-string (car org-time-stamp-formats)
                                    (seconds-to-time start))
                <span class="org-string">"----------------\n"</span>)
        (org-dblock-write:clocktable
         (plist-put
          (plist-put
           params
           <span class="org-builtin">:tstart</span>
           (format-time-string (car org-time-stamp-formats)
                               (seconds-to-time start)))
          <span class="org-builtin">:tend</span>
          (format-time-string (car org-time-stamp-formats)
                              (seconds-to-time end))))
        (setq start (+ 86400 start))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
After you load that code, you'll be able to use a dynamic block of the
form
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+BEGIN: rangereport :maxlevel 2 :tstart "&lt;2007-12-25 Tue&gt;" :tend "&lt;2007-12-30 Sun&gt;"
...
#+END:
</pre>

<p>
to see your time reported by date. Fill it in by moving your cursor
within the block and typing C-c C-x C-u (org-dblock-update).
</p>

<p>
Org makes it easy to capture timeclock information by integrating the
timeclock into your task list so that you don't even have to think about
it, and it can report this time by project or by date. You can use this
information to bill clients, improve your time estimates, or reflect on
the way you do things. All you have to do is clock in by marking a task
as STARTED, and clock out by marking a task as WAITING or DONE. Don't
get discouraged if the time clock shows you do only a few hours of
productive work each day. Use that to help you figure out how to do to
things better!
