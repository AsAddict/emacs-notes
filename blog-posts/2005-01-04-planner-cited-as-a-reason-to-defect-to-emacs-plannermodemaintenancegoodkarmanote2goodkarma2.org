  You point is well taken. I find myself living in an application more
  and more. At work, it's my editor
   and I'd like it to handle the G.T.D. tasks and my schedule. I never
  set out to do this, I've just seen it
   happening.

Tyler will probably love being able to create hyperlinked tasks from
anywhere. =)
