#+TITLE: Testing from Emacs

I'm using
[[http://elisp.info/package/weblogger/weblogger.el][weblogger.el]] and
[[http://elisp.info/package/xml-rpc/xml-rpc.el][xml-rpc.el]] to post
directly to my WordPress.

I wonder how well it works...

Sorry about the RSS thrashing! <sheepish grin> It took a while for the
idea of a test blog to occur to me. So sorry. =)

In conclusion: Emacs posting to external weblogs -- not quite there yet.
Weblogger.el is somewhat okay, g-client and atom-api didn't work at all
on my system. Waah. Quite frustrating.
