When I learn something new, I always find myself wishing there was some
kind of map to help me figure out where to start, how to track progress,
and what to learn next. So now I'm making them. Here's one for learning
[[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode]], a popular outline/TODO/everything-else
mode for the Emacs text editor. You can probably figure out the relevant
manual sections to read based on the keywords, but feel free to ask in
the comments if you need more help.

Here's another short guide with suggestions for evolving your Org file
organization:

And here's the one-page cheat sheet I made before helping someone dig
into tracking time with Org. It's a great way to measure your time on
specific tasks.
