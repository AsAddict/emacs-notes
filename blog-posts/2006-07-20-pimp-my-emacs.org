Along the lines of TV shows like Pimp My Ride, I'm thinking of
 regularly blogging something along the lines of Pimp My Emacs. For
 those readers who haven't had to listen to me bubble for hours on end
 about this text editor / way of life, Emacs is ostensibly a program
 that you use to edit text files. Right. But because it's insanely
 programmable, there are all sorts of interesting things for it, like
 more than five ways to read one's e-mail.
