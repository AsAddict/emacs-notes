  Well, I was using the excellent new planner-create-note-from-task, and
   thought, “wouldn't it be nice to have the note optionally created on
  the
   plan page rather than the (less useful) date page? I must ask Sacha
  to
   do that.”

  And then I thought, “No! I'll venture into the previously unchartered
   depths of lisp programming... and work out how to do it myself.”

  Here's my diff. Pass a prefix argument to always create on the plan
   page. Perhaps this should be the default -- Sacha's call, I guess.

  Be gentle, it's my first proper lisp coding :)

Wheeeeee! Another person discovered the joys of Emacs Lisp hacking!

See, Planner is easy to hack. =)
