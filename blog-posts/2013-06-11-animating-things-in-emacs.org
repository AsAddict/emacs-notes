Some years ago, I came across *M-x animate-birthday-present* (and
therefore *animate-string*and*animate-sequence*) while reading through
the output of *M-x apropos-command RET . RET*, which lists all of the
interactive commands. (Well worth exploring! The Emacs Manual also lists
a few unusual things under
“[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Amusements.html][Amusements.]]”)
It's one of my favourite examples of odd things you can find in Emacs,
like *M-x doctor* and *M-x tetris.* I use animate-string to create the
title sequences of Emacs chats

one with Bastien Guerry]].

It turns out that lots of people use the Emacs text editor for animating
things. Andrea Rossetti (from Trieste, Italy) e-mailed to share this
little thing he put together to simulate
[[https://github.com/thesoftwarebin/the-emacs-software-bin/blob/master/teletype.el][typing
in Emacs]]. And, boggle of boggles, someone even taught a *course* on
[[http://dantorop.info/project/emacs-animation/][Emacs Lisp
Animations]].

Next: Maybe someone can make an onion-skin animation mode to go on top
of artist-mode so that we can make Emacs flipbooks?
