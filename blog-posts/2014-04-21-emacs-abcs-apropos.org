Sometimes one gets the strangest ideas. I've had this kicking around in
my brain for a few weeks. Since you read and re-read books to kids
endless times anyway, why not learn more yourself along the way? For
example, Emacs is something that is worth repeated learning. You forget
commands, you rediscover them, you dig into them more. I think it might
be interesting to have kid's books with technical subtext. While you're
saying the letters and helping kids learn to read, you can silently (or
not-so-silently!) read the notes, and pick one command to try later. In
this case: M-x apropos?
