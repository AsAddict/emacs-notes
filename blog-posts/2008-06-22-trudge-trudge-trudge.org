Oh no, I've hit the slump.

I spent some time working on the Wicked Cool Emacs today. Spam filtering
-- not something I'd set up before. I'm writing it because I promised to
write it, but I can't shake off the feeling that this part would be
better done by someone who's passionate about Emacs and spam filtering.
I have Google handle my spam filtering for me, so I haven't needed to do
anything more sophisticated. Still, not everyone's going to have the
same set-up, so it would be good to document that too.

I'm tempted to jump to a different chapter and start working on that,
just to make working on the book fun again.
