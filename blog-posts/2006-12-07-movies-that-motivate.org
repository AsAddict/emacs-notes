Kevin McIntosh just linked me up with an interesting
 motivational speaker named Emmanuel Lopez who's starting a movie /
networking series at the Royal Ontario Museum this January. =) Check out
[[http://motivatorman.blogspot.com/][Emmanuel Lopez's blog]] to find out
more about the series and the guy!

You know what I *really* want? A weekly / monthly feel-good
 conversation salon at which we talk about inspiring things and what's
 going *well*... A gratitude group, a happiness hangout, a joyful
jubilee! =)
