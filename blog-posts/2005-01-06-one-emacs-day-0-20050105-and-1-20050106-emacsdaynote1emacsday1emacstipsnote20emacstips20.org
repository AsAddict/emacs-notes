([[EmacsDay#note1][EmacsDay:1]]”[[EmacsTips#note20][EmacsTips:20]])

(Technically, one and a half, because this is the first entry)

Here are interesting tidbits from irc://irc.freenode.net/#emacs

Code

- =M-x column-number-mode= makes Emacs show column numbers.
 - =emms-locate= is a useful way to play selected media files.
 - Powerful buffer switching: With either iswitchb or ido, C-x b C-s.
ido seems to be better than iswitchb for multitty Emacs, and comes with
CVS GNU Emacs. iswitchb is in GNU Emacs and the edit-utils package for
XEmacs. If you want to stick with iswitchb fulltime, add
=(iswitchb-default-keybindings) to your init.el. - ess (emacs spreadsheet): ==set-variable set-goal-column nil=
for neater navigation
 - emms: =(define-key dired-mode-map [.] 'emms-play-dired)= after dired
is already loaded
 - Editing XML: Many people recommend nxml (GNU Emacs only). xsl-mode is
also useful even for other XML files. xsl-mode indentation is better
than xml-mode, too. xsl-mode is in the xslide package, and in the cygwin
sumo package.
 - If you want Python files recognized, install python-mode and
=(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist (cons "\\.py\\'" 'python-mode))=
 - Gnus: You can use B DEL to delete drafts.
 - Recursion in lambdas!
=(funcall #1=(lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (funcall #1# (1- n))))) 5)=
- result: 120. Not recommended.
 - Use M-x goto-line to go to the nth line.
 - To copy the font setting and color-theme of the old frame when you
create a new frame:
=(defadvice make-frame (around frob-frame-parameters activate) (let ((default-frame-alist (frame-parameters))) ad-do-it))=
 - How to get rid of all the \^Ms at the end of lines:
=M-% C-q C-m RET C-q RET RET= . (Better solution:
=M-x revert-buffer-with-coding-system=, dos.)
 - =desktop= can make Emacs jump to the previous position in a file when
you reopen the file
 - Setting auto-fill in file comments:
=-*- mode: major; mode: auto-fill -*-=, where major is the major mode
you want

Issues

- ess toolbar variables (customization) need to be set before ess is
loaded, but ess is loaded in site-start. How do you set it, then?

Misc

- ljupdate darcs repository:
[[http://edward.oconnor.cx/code/ljupdate/][http://edward.oconnor.cx/code/ljupdate/]]
 - ERC seems to be the most popular IRC client.
 - Have you checked out the Emacs LiveJournal community?
[[http://www.livejournal.com/community/emacs/][http://www.livejournal.com/community/emacs/]]
 - Don't worry about losing local changes when you modify the source
code of CVS Emacs. CVS does patches.
 - Emacs under screen: C-\ might be a good Screen escape key.
 - People use normal synchronization tools like rsync, unison, and CVS
to sync their planner.el pages between computers.
 - Hook variables named -hook tend to not take arguments, while hook
variables named -functions might be called with arguments.
 - Debian: /etc/emacs/site-start.d and
/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/debian-startup.el are responsible for lines
like “Loading 00debian-vars (source)...”, while
/usr/lib/emacsen-common/emacs-package-install is called when the deb is
being set up.
