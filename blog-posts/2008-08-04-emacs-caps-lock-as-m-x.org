Inspired by Lennart Borgman's recent post on help.gnu.emacs about
[[http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.emacs.help/msg/5196ae31694b6052][binding
Caps Lock to M-x on Microsoft Windows]], I set my system up with the
Linux equivalent.

To make Caps Lock a shortcut for M-x, add the following lines to your
~/.emacs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if (eq window-system 'x)
        (shell-command "xmodmap -e 'clear Lock' -e 'keycode 66 = F13'"))
    (global-set-key [f13] 'execute-extended-command)
#+END_EXAMPLE
