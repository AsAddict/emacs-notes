I wanted a quick way to visually distinguish DONE tasks from tasks I
still need to do. This
[[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2007-03/msg00179.html][handy
snippet from the Emacs Org-mode mailing list]] does the trick by
striking through the headlines for DONE tasks.

Here's the code:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq org-fontify-done-headline t)
    (custom-set-faces
     '(org-done ((t (:foreground "PaleGreen"   
                     :weight normal
                     :strike-through t))))
     '(org-headline-done 
                ((((class color) (min-colors 16) (background dark)) 
                   (:foreground "LightSalmon" :strike-through t)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE
