#+TITLE: Getting R and ggplot2 to work in Emacs Org Mode Babel blocks; also, tracking the number of TODOs

http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/05/getting-r-ggplot2-work-emacs-org-mode-babel-blocks-also-tracking-number-todos/

I started tracking the number of tasks I had in Org Mode so that I could find out if my TODO list tended to shrink or grow. It was easy to write a function in Emacs Lisp to count the number of tasks in different states and summarize them in a table.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results raw append
  (defun sacha/org-count-tasks-by-status ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((counts (make-hash-table :test 'equal))
          (today (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d" (current-time)))
          values output)
      (org-map-entries
       (lambda ()
         (let* ((status (elt (org-heading-components) 2)))
           (when status
             (puthash status (1+ (or (gethash status counts) 0)) counts))))
       nil
       'agenda)
      (setq values (mapcar (lambda (x)
                             (or (gethash x counts) 0))
                           '("DONE" "STARTED" "TODO" "WAITING" "DELEGATED" "CANCELLED" "SOMEDAY")))
      (setq output
            (concat "| " today " | "
                    (mapconcat 'number-to-string values " | ")
                    " | "
                    (number-to-string (apply '+ values))
                    " | "
                    (number-to-string
                     (round (/ (* 100.0 (car values)) (apply '+ values))))
                    "% |"))
      (if (called-interactively-p 'any)
          (insert output)
        output)))

I wanted to graph this with Gnuplot, but it turns out that Gnuplot is difficult to integrate with Emacs on Microsoft Windows. I gave up after a half an hour of poking at it, since search results indicated there were long-standing problems with how Gnuplot got input from Emacs. Besides, I'd been meaning to learn more [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] anyway, and R is more powerful when it comes to statistics and data visualization.

Getting R to work with Org Mode babel blocks in Emacs on Windows was a challenge. Here are some of the things I ran into.

The first step was easy: Add R to the list of languages I could evaluate in a source block (I already had dot and ditaa from previous experiments).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((dot . t)
     (ditaa . t) 
     (R . t)))
#+end_src

But my code didn't execute at all, even when I was trying something that printed out results instead of drawing images. I got a little lost trying to dig into =org-babel-execute:R= with =edebug=, eventually ending up in =comint.el=. The real solution was even easier. I had incorrectly set =inferior-R-program-name= to the path of R in my configuration, which made =M-x R= work but which meant that Emacs was looking in the wrong place for the options to pass to R (which Org Babel relied on). The correct way to do this is to leave =inferior-R-program-name= with the default value (=Rterm=) and make sure that my system path included *both* the =bin= directory and the =bin\x64= directory.

Then I had to pick up the basics of R again. It took me a little time to figure out that I needed to parse the columns I pulled in from Org, using =strptime= to convert the date column and =as.numeric= to convert the numbers. Eventually, I got it to plot some results with the regular =plot= command.

#+begin_src R :var data=burndown :results graphics :file uploads/2014/04/r-plot.png  :exports both
dates <- strptime(as.character(data$Date), "%Y-%m-%d")
tasks_done <- as.numeric(data$DONE)
tasks_uncancelled <- as.numeric(data$Total) - as.numeric(data$CANC.)
df <- data.frame(dates, tasks_done, tasks_uncancelled)
plot(x=dates, y=tasks_uncancelled, ylim=c(0,max(tasks_uncancelled)))
lines(x=dates, y=tasks_uncancelled, col="blue", type="o")
lines(x=dates, y=tasks_done, col="green", type="o")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:uploads/2014/04/r-plot.png]]

I wanted prettier graphs, though. I installed the =ggplot2= package and started figuring it out. No matter what I did, though, I ended up with a blank white image instead of my graph. If I used =M-x R= instead of evaluating the src block, the code worked. Weird! Eventually I found out that adding =print(...)= around my =ggplot= made it display the image correctly. Yay! Now I had what I wanted.

#+begin_src R :var data=burndown :results graphics :file uploads/2014/04/r-graph.png  :exports both
library(ggplot2)
dates <- strptime(as.character(data$Date), "%Y-%m-%d")
tasks_done <- as.numeric(data$DONE)
tasks_uncancelled <- as.numeric(data$Total) - as.numeric(data$CANC.)
df <- data.frame(dates, tasks_done, tasks_uncancelled)
plot = ggplot(data=df, aes(x=dates, y=tasks_done, ymin=0)) + geom_line(color="#009900") + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(y=tasks_uncancelled), color="blue") + geom_point(aes(y=tasks_uncancelled))
print(plot)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:uploads/2014/04/r-graph.png]]

The blue line represents the total number of tasks (except for the cancelled ones), and the green line represents tasks that are done.

Here's something that looks a little more like a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart][burn down chart]], since it shows just the number of things to be done:

#+begin_src R :var data=burndown :results graphics :file uploads/2014/04/r-graph-2.png  :exports both
library(ggplot2)
dates <- strptime(as.character(data$Date), "%Y-%m-%d")
tasks_remaining <- as.numeric(data$Total) - as.numeric(data$CANC.) - as.numeric(data$DONE)
df <- data.frame(dates, tasks_remaining)
plot = ggplot(data=df, aes(x=dates, y=tasks_remaining, ymin=0)) + geom_line(color="#009900") + geom_point()
print(plot)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:r-graph-2.png]]

The drastic decline there is me realizing that I had lots of tasks
that were no longer relevant, not me being super-productive. =)

As it turns out, I tend to add new tasks at about the rate that I
finish them (or slightly more). I think this is okay. It means I'm
working on things that have next steps, and next steps, and steps
beyond that. If I add more tasks, that gives me more variety to choose
from. Besides, I have a lot of repetitive tasks, so those never get
marked as DONE over here.

Anyway, cool! Now that I've gotten R to work on my system, you'll
probably see it in even more of these blog posts. =D Hooray for Org Babel and R!
