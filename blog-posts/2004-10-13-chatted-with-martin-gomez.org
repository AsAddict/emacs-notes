Had a lot of fun talking to Martin Gomez about wanting to join the
 Media Lab. I told him about \_personal\_ personal information managers
 and how much fun I have tweaking planner for people's needs. In the
 process of explaining just what I was so excited about, I learned a
 bit more about what I want to do. I want to do a longitudinal study of
 how people's usage patterns change as their PIMs grow with them.
