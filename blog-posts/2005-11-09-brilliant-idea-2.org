I'm going to make this weekend Planner Documenting weekend. Kinda like
 the [[http://www.nanowrimo.org][National Novel Writing Month]]â€˜s goal
 of just getting stuff out there. I'll put it on the wiki so that
 people can bang on it. =)

I need to block off Saturday evening for Michael's party, but I'll
 keep the rest of my weekend free. What do I need to do? I need to sit
 down and write a from-scratch guide for Emacs and everything. And a
 Why Use Planner thing. And something about Planner philosophies.
