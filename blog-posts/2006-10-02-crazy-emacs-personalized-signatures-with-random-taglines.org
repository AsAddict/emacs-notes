Of course, that naturally leads to the crazy idea: “What if I can
 personalize my signatures?” Knowing that Paul Lussier is an Emacs geek,
I can reward him for reading all the way
 to the bottom of my message... ;)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun sacha/gnus-personalize-signature ()
      "Personalizes signature based on BBDB signature field.
    BBDB signature field should be a lambda expression.
    First person with a custom signature field gets used."
      (let* ((bbdb-get-addresses-headers
              (list (assoc 'recipients bbdb-get-addresses-headers)))
             (records (bbdb-update-records
                       (bbdb-get-addresses
                        nil
                        gnus-ignored-from-addresses 'gnus-fetch-field)
                       nil
                       nil))
             signature)
        (while (and records (not signature))
          (when (bbdb-record-getprop (car records) 'signature)
            (setq signature
                  (eval (read (bbdb-record-getprop (car records)
                                                   'signature)))))
          (setq records (cdr records)))
        (or signature t)))
    (setq-default message-signature 'sacha/gnus-personalize-signature)
#+END_EXAMPLE

So then all I have to do is add the following field to his record:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
          signature: (concat "Sacha Chua - Emacs geek
                     What crazy idea can I help you hack next?
                     Random Emacs symbol: "
                     (sacha/random-tagline
                      "~/.taglines.random-emacs-symbols"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Emacs. One crazy idea at a time. Now I can use this to select random
 information, like my favorite networking books or a list of my
 upcoming events...
