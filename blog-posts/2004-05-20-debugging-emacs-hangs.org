  Run emacs in gdb, preferably from the src directory where you compiled
  emacs:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
         $ cd ~/emacs-build/src
         $ gdb ./emacs
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  [There's a special .gdbinit file in that directory that defines handy
  emacs
   debugging commands.]

  When it hangs, hit C-z or something to exit to the debugger (you can't
  use
   C-c like usual when debugging emacs, because emacs' standard .gdbinit
  file
   changes gdb's SIGINT handling to make C-g work properly on ttys).

  Then look at a C backtrace (“backtrace”) and lisp backtrace
  (“xbacktrace”)
   to see what's up.

  For more fun, do the above from another emacs session using emacs'
  `M-x gdb'
   command.
