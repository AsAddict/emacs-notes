I'm thinking of making it easier for me to blog to my
 [[http://www.advogato.org/diary/][http://www.advogato.org/diary/]] . I
should look at the blogging Emacs
 modules to see how (or if) they handle offline operation. I think I
 can do it like e-mail -- queue unsent items in a file, then delete as
 sent. If all else fails, I can write it as a normal e-mail module,
 then have a Perl script on the other end upload the e-mailed stuff to
 [[http://www.advogato.org][http://www.advogato.org]] .

I guess this belongs more to remember.el than planner.el, as I want to
 mirror upon remember. =)
