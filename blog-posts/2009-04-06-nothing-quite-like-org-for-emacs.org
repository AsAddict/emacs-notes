#+TITLE: Nothing quite like Org for Emacs

I've been trying lots of different Web-based GTD task managers like
[[http://www.rememberthemilk.com][Remember the Milk]],
[[http://www.toodledo.com][Toodledo]], and
[[http://www.gtdagenda.com][GTDAgenda]]. I'm slowly coming to the
conclusion that there's nothing quite like [[http://orgmode.org/][Org
for Emacs]].

Here's what I like about the other services:

-  Both Remember the Milk and Toodledo have iPhone/iPod Touch
   interfaces, so I can review, check off, and create tasks anywhere.
-  All those services allow me to e-mail tasks to an address.
-  It's easy to filter tasks by context.
-  I can share my tasks with my assistant so that he or she can remind
   me of the tasks I've scheduled for the day.

Here's what I like about Org:

-  I can use templates and outlines to organize my tasks however I want.
-  I can set deadlines, scheduled tasks, and prior notice easily.
-  I can track time more finely than Toodledo can.
-  I can use Org as an activity log.
-  I can schedule tasks onto specific timeslots.

Of all the options I've tried, Toodledo is closest to where I am with
Org, although it still doesn't do everything.

Some options are:

-  Use worg or develop a web-based interface for displaying tasks based
   on my Org file
-  Write code for synchronizing Org with Toodledo or RememberTheMilk,
   making lots of geeks happy in the process =)
