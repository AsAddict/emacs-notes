The best system is the one you grow yourself. How do you take notes?

I mindmap a lot. Although mindmapping on paper is a lot of fun,
 [[http://freemind.sourceforge.net][Freemind]]â€˜s keyword shortcuts lets
 me mindmap nearly as quickly.

I haven't opened Freemind in a while, though. Can't be bothered to
 switch out of Emacs. My talks usually start out as text outlines. I
 don't write it all in one swoop. I type random keywords, backtrack,
 fill in, rewrite... Sometimes I pull out a sheet of paper and redo my
 mindmap there, reorganizing it in the process. When I'm happy with the
 sequence, it gets turned into OpenOffice.org slides.

For random snippets, I use Planner because it's so easy to blog text
 from my current window. People who use web browsers a lot might want
 to check out [[http://www.bloglines.com][Bloglines]],
 [[http://del.icio.us][del.icio.us]],
 [[http://quicknote.mozdev.org][QuickNote]], and other Web annotation
tools.

I think that making it easier to get stuff out of your head is the
 first thing you have to do. You can worry about the quality of said
 stuff later. ;)

As for the note about extreme programming: you might want to check out
 David Allen's Getting Things Done method. It emphasizes focusing small
 accomplishments and reflecting. =)
