After struggling with
[[http://sachachua.com/notebook/emacs/emacspeak-config.el][../emacs/emacspeak-config.el]],
Emacs with
 Emacspeak now boots all the way up to my tasks. Now I get to play with
 it a whole lot more. Next step -- get another Twiddler (Dr. Rodrigo
 said that the department will spring for it). Also, check out gestures
 for Emacs. Oh, and have lots of fun... =)

emacspeak-planner.el in
[[http://sachachua.com/notebook/emacs/emacs-wiki][../emacs/emacs-wiki]]
has preliminary
 support. emacspeak doesn't seem to like invisible text in emacs-wiki.
 Fix one of these days.
