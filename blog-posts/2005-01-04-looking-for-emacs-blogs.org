I'd love to read more about the wonderful editor/way-of-life that is
 Emacs. Know of any Emacs-related blogs? (Occasional off-topics are
 fine.) Please e-mail the URL to me at
[[mailto:sacha@free.net.ph][sacha@free.net.ph]] or use the
 comment form.

You can check out
[[http://del.icio.us/sachac/emacs+blogs][http://del.icio.us/sachac/emacs+blogs]]
for a list of
 blogs so far.

I plan to aggregate blogs into a general blog feed and an
 Emacs-specific blog feed.
