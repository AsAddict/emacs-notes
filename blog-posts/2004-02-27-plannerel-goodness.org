  I think the work you put into Planner et al is fantastic. I have spent
   quite a bit of time over the past week poring over your web page and
  .el
   files and just wanted to take a second to say thank you for all your
   work. I have recently switched to Emacs as my text-editor and
  sincerely
   appreciate sites like yours which help me understand it better. Thank
   you!
