#+TITLE: Emacs: Show only people whom I haven't pinged since...

One of the things I want in a contact management system is a quick way
 to find out who I haven't pinged in a while. The following code
 filters currently-displayed contacts to show who I might want to get
 back in touch with. Call it from a *BBDB* window and specify the date
 (could be 2006.01.01 for annual, -7 for the last seven days, etc.).
 This works incredibly well with the following hacks:

-  [[http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/2006.09.01.php#anchor-2][Emacs:
   Keep track of messages sent]]
-  [[http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/2006.06.03.php#anchor-5][BBDB
   pinging code]]

I should write a small book about how to build a contact management
 system with Emacs. ;) It's insanely powerful, you know.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (require 'planner)
    (require 'bbdb)
    (defun sacha/bbdb-show-only-no-contact-since (date)
      "Show only people who haven't been pinged since DATE or at all."
      (interactive (list (planner-read-date)))
      (let ((records bbdb-records)
            new-records
            last-match
            omit
            notes)
        (while records
          ;; Find the latest date mentioned in the entry
          (setq notes (or (bbdb-record-notes (caar records)) ""))
          (setq last-match nil omit nil)
          (while (string-match
                  "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\\.[0-9][0-9]\\.[0-9][0-9]"
                  notes
                  (or last-match 0))
            (unless (string> date (match-string 0 notes))
              (setq omit t)
              (setq last-match (length notes)))
            (setq last-match (match-end 0)))
          (unless (and last-match omit)
            (add-to-list 'new-records (caar records) t))
          (setq records (cdr records)))
        (bbdb-display-records new-records)))

One of the other things I'd like to smooth over is keeping track of
 who owes whom e-mail... <laugh>
