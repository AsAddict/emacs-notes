Remember my crazy idea to sell
[[http://sachachua.com/advertise-on-my-laptop.html][advertising space on
my laptop]] during
[[http://barcamp.org/BarCampEarthToronto][BarCampEarthToronto]]? Well,
Matt Mullenweg of [[http://wordpress.org][WordPress.org]] --
*WORDPRESS.ORG!* My favorite blogging platform! (Okay, my
*second-favorite* -- nothing beats Emacs Planner)

!!

They are *uber*cool. Another thing I really, really, really, really
like. Whenever I need to set up a blog for someone else, the very first
thing I do is download the latest version of WordPress, unpack it, and
set it up. I like it a lot.

So here's what's going to happen. I am going to make the logos for
[[http://software.orangeandbronze.com][Orange & Bronze]] and
[[http://www.wordpress.org][WordPress.org]] as large as I can. I don't
mind potentially wasting space. It'll be a *fantastic* story.

I'll blog more from [[http://barcamp.org/BarCampEarthToronto][BarCamp]]
tomorrow, and I'll post my D*I*Y tutorial on Sunday. =) Or today, if I
feel particularly diligent...

Anyway. [[http://www.wordpress.org][WordPress.org]]. They are totally,
totally cool.
