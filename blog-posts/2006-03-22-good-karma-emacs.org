  One day, about 2 years ago now (Holy Cow! Sacha, has it been *that*
   long? :) I stumbled upon this thing called emacs-wiki and
   planner-mode. I fired off an e-mail to the maintainer asking a couple
   of questions. Someone named Sacha answered back and had such
   enthusiasm for my e-mail and my questions that i immediately joined
   the list and started playing with planner and emacs-wiki.
