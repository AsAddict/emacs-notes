Wayne will get a kick out of the fact that I wrote a function to help
 me set up Emacs to do a little of what his Nintendo DS does...

(Just you wait until I get speech recognition, sir!)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ;; Create a flashcard-type file for the multiplication table until 15
    (insert
     (mapconcat
      'identity
      (shuffle-vector
       (apply
        'vector
        (apply
         'append
         (let ((list '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15)))
           (mapcar
            (lambda (a)
              (mapcar
               (lambda (b)
                 (format "%d x %d = : %d" a b (* a b)))
               list))
            list)))))
      "\n"))
