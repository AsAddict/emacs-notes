I'm now using swish++ to index and search my mail. It's really handy,
 particularly with the patched nnir.el and
 doc/examples/email\_indexing/Email-Indexing-Mini-Howto.txt . I've set
 it up to index my misc mail and my planner mail, as those are the
 things I search rather often. Should set it up to incrementally index
 things before I go to sleep.
