So that's why I haven't been able to upload my CVS stuff lately. You can
still get planner from
[[http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/planner/planner.el][http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/planner/planner.el]]
. All of the files in the CVS repository are available at
[[http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/emacs-wiki/][http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/emacs/emacs-wiki/]]
.
