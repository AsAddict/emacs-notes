#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    For helping teach my kid to read I used emacs running emacspeak.
    The robotic language, via the eflite speech synthesis server, was
    sufficient to get the words' pronunciation across.  Type
    "D-O-G-" in a buffer and you get the audio feedback "dog."
    I used to set the xterm to the most massive font size available
    (by adjusting the font and screen sizes) to make reading, or so I
    assumed, easier for preschool eyes.
