#+TITLE: New planner tweak: sort tasks by time

[[http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2969][http://sachachua.com/blog/p/2969]]

I've taken to tagging my tasks with times, and here's some code to
 automatically sort tasks by time, status, and priority. I use it on
 day pages. My plan pages are sorted differently. =)

I could go on and on about how powerful customizable task sorting
 functions are. Kudos to Jody Klymak and John Sullivan for suggesting
 this last December! It's one of the things I love about
[[http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/planner][planner]]. =)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun sacha/planner-sort-tasks-basic ()
      "Sort tasks by time (@1030, etc), status (_P>XC) and priority (ABC)."
      (let* ((info (planner-current-task-info))
             (status (aref (planner-task-status info) 0)))
        (concat
         ;; time
         (or (and (string-match "@[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]" (planner-task-description info))
                  (match-string 0 (planner-task-description info)))
             "@9999")
         ;; status
         (cond
          ((eq status ?o) "1")
          ((eq status ?P) "2")
          ((eq status ?>) "3")
          ((eq status ?X) "4")
          ((eq status ?C) "5")
          (t "9"))
         (planner-task-priority info))))
#+END_EXAMPLE
