      Hi sachac :-)
      i've been following your planner mode pages for a while, I must say it's a great project
      dto: Awwwww, thanks! =)
      dto: You can go thank johnw for that. My job is just to patch the bugs I accidentally introduce, and
              occasionally make a bunch of people really happy by figuring out how to hack something cool into it. =)
      sachac: I use nnrss/gnus to read your feed :-)
      anyway I think you're doing great, i'd love to offer feedback
      dto: Awwwwww... =)
      i'm planning to use it for organizing my work, it's very hectic and i manage multiple
           projects/tasks/contacts/emails etc
      dto: Wow, neat! =)
