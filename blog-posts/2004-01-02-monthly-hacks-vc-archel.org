I will finish at least one major hack per month. This month's special
 is vc-arch.el, which for some reason does not seem available on the
 Net. I have sketches of it up at
[[http://sachachua.com/notebook/emacs/emacs-wiki/vc-arch.el][../emacs/emacs-wiki/vc-arch.el]].
I
 feel that if nothing else, at least I'll have a mode that makes it
 easier for me to manage my planner work.

Getting a diff through C-x v = already works. I want to be able to
 commit my changes with a quick C-x v v. If more than one file has been
 modified, I want a dired-like buffer displayed so that I can select
 which files to commit.
