Actually, subcategories are already handled by separate plan pages, so
 I don't need subtopics any more. I would, however, like to see all the
 note headlines, possibly bounded by certain dates. That would be fun.
 In which case, I don't need to merge anything in from planner-notes -
 I can just work with the export functions I already have in
 planner-experimental.
