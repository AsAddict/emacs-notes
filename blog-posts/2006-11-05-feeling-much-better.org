I was in bed all day yesterday thanks to a very annoying fever and the
 beginning of a sore throat. It was very nice of Simon to come over
 with chicken soup, a salad, and the best medicine available. =) I
 didn't really feel like eating, but he watched over me and made sure I
 finished everything.

Now I feel much better. Good, because there's much work to be done!
