So I \_finally\_ pulled everything together and got my Gnus chapter out
the door. Hooray, hooray, hooray!

Disclaimers: It's rough, it probably makes a few assumptions about
whatever version of Emacs I'm running, it's probably missing your
favorite tips (and I'd love to add them!), and it probably has typos.
Meep. But it's out there!

Hooray, hooray, hooray!

Next step: write about web-browsing in Emacs...
