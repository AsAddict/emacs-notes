Will wonders never cease... Just ran across another
 emacs-wiki-related module today. This produces RSS feeds and seems to
 be a superset of planner-rss.el, focusing more on plain emacs-wiki
 projects. It seems to use planner-style names, though.

Hmm. This syndicates entire pages. planner-rss.el syndicates items.
 Interesting...
