So here's how to access Facebook from w3m, one of the web browsers in
 Emacs:

1. Enable cookies by setting w3m-use-cookies to t.
 2. Go to http://m.facebook.com .
 3. Choose the HTTP login.
 4. Log in with your username and password.

Hooray for mobile interfaces that don't require Javascript! =D

So far, it seems to work. I can update my status! Sweet!

Next step: Figure out how to set up shimbun for Facebook mail so that I
can read my Facebook mail like a newsgroup...
