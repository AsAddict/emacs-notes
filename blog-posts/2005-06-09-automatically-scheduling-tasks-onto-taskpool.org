    (defadvice planner-create-task-from-buffer (before paul activate)
      "Automatically schedule task onto TaskPool as well as other projects."
      (if plan-page
          (unless (string-match plan-page "TaskPool")
            (setq plan-page (concat plan-page planner-multi-separator "TaskPool")))

Here's another snippet that will unschedule tasks from
[[http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/TaskPool][TaskPool]] when
 you mark them completed with C-c C-x (planner-task-done). Nifty stuff,
 huh?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defadvice planner-task-done (after paul activate)
      "Remove completed tasks from the TaskPool if that still leaves them linked."
      (let ((info (planner-current-task-info)))
        (when (planner-task-link-text info)
          ;; If it is linked to TaskPool _and_ at least one other thing
          (if (string-match planner-multi-separator (planner-task-link-text info))
              (planner-multi-replan-task
               (planner-multi-make-link (planner-multi-filter-links "^TaskPool$" (planner-multi-task-link-as-list info) t)))
            ;; Else if it has a date and is linked to TaskPool
            (if (and (planner-task-date info)
                     (string= (planner-task-link info) "TaskPool"))
                (planner-replan-task nil))))))

Primitive calculating machines existed long before computers were
developed.
