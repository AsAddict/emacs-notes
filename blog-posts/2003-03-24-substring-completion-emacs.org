Le Wang mentions icomplete and mcomplete in reference to substring
 completion in a March 4 post on the
[[mailto:help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org][help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org]] mailing
 list. Hmmmm. mcomplete doesn't seem to be built-in, but icomplete's
 there, and it's nifty. It's like ido handling of buffers and files. I
 like.
