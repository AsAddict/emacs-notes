Thanks to Matthew Darling's comment on
[[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/01/helping-people-learn-more-about-programming/][my
post about code coaching]], I came across Avdi Grimm's work with pair
programming -- and was delighted to find that he uses Emacs too. =)
Check out my Skype chat with Avdi about Org-mode literate programming,
Ruby, and how he got started with Emacs.
