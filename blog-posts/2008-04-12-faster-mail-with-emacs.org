I spent a few minutes getting offlineimap to synchronize my Gmail
messages with dovecot, an IMAP server on my laptop. I also set up Gnus
to work with the messages. Now I'm having /fun/ speeding through my
inbox. I don't know why, but my text-based terminal seems a lot zippier
and a lot easier to work with than Gmail... =)

I'm glad I'm back to doing my mail in Emacs!
