Woohoo! I finished the Emacs mail productivity article that
 Don Marti asked me to write. If you look back at
 my past few days of inbox entries, you'll note that I haven't really
 been staying at Inbox Zero -- but at least it feels manageable. I also
 threw in a few more tips, like mail scoring. Much much much fun.

I'll let them publish it first, 'cause they're paying me for it. Then
 I'll repost it over here after some time... =)

Well, that was fun. =D

Random Emacs symbol: keyboard-coding-system -- Function: Return coding
