  Hooks and more hooks -- As IÃ¢Â€Â™ve repeated until IÃ¢Â€Â™m hoarse,
  apps like Quicksilver change the way you use
   your Mac. Drastically. Ditto for any app thatÃ¢Â€Â™s open to
  interaction via (the vastly underutilized) OS X
   Services. There are smart ways to provide some kind of access to most
  any program without switching from
   the foreground app and the task at hand. I want ways to append
  information, create new items, and do any
   Ã¢Â€ÂœcapturingÃ¢Â€Â? from wherever I am. At the very least, I want a
  universal Ã¢Â€Âœdrop boxÃ¢Â€Â? to which I can
   periodically return to process, file, and enrich any kind of
  productivity app data (reminders, phone
   numbers, notes, etc.).

See, Planner's onto something here.

We're not very good at ad hoc collections, though.
