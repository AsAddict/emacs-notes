Since people found my
[[http://sachachua.com/blog/sketchnotes2012][collection of sketchnotes
from 2012]] handy, I've put together a categorized collection of
sketchnotes from 2013 as well. Enjoy! =)

/Behind the scenes/

This was how I made the 2012 collection:

1. Create a Microsoft Powerpoint presentation. Fill it with high-res
   images. Resize and position all the images. Use AutoHotkey to save
   myself time and avoid going crazy.
2. Create a spreadsheet with titles and page numbers. Add captions with
   liberal use of AutoHotkey.
3. Create a manual table of contents and link to all the images. Mostly
   use AutoHotkey, except for the part where if you create a link to a
   slide number that consists of repeated numbers (ex: 55 or 66), you
   have to select it a different way, because typing “55″ gets you #51
   (and “555″ gets you #52, etc).
4. Save as PDF.

There was a lot of manual fiddling around involved in making that
collection, so I'm experimenting with a different approach that may be
useful. For Sketchnotes 2013, I wanted to see if there were ways I could
simplify the packaging process while enabling people to do other things
with the files.

Here's what I did:

1. I used Emacs dired-mode's C-x C-q (=dired-toggle-read-only=) to go
   into editable mode, which allowed me to easily edit all the filenames
   to include #keywords. I used C-x C-q to save the changes.
2. Then I used Emacs dired's % m to select multiple files by regular
   expressions and R to move the files into a specified directory.
3. Tada! Neatly organized files. I packaged it up as a ZIP and put it on
   Gumroad.
4. Since Dropbox also allows you to share folders, I created a public
   link to the folder that had my organized sketches. That way, people
   can download a single directory if they want to, instead of
   downloading all 250+ MB.

It still might be interesting to make a PDF, especially if I can make
one that can be published through something like CreateSpace. More
packaging... =)
