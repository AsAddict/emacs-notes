#+TITLE: Emacs 24 and the package manager

Update: Added (require â€˜package) -- thanks, Ryan!

By default, the Emacs 24 package manager (=M-x package-list-packages=)
points to a small repository of Emacs packages. Want more?
[[http://technomancy.us/144][Phil Hagelberg]] added support for multiple
repositories to package.el. There's the original ELPA at
[[http://tromey.com/elpa][http://tromey.com/elpa]], and there's a
community package source called Marmalade that anyone can upload
packages to. Add this to your =~/.emacs= and evaluate it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (require 'package)
    ;; Add the original Emacs Lisp Package Archive
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("elpa" . "http://tromey.com/elpa/"))
    ;; Add the user-contributed repository
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

You should then be able to call =M-x package-list-packages= to browse
and install Emacs packages.

If you don't have
[[http://sachachua.com/blog/2010/12/whats-new-in-emacs-24/][Emacs 24]]
yet (and you might want to wait for the official release if you use
things like BBDB), Phil suggests downloading
[[http://bit.ly/pkg-el][package.el]] from the Emacs development tree.
This version includes support for multiple repositories.

For even more Emacs goodness outside the package system, check out
[[https://github.com/emacsmirror][the Emacs mirror]], which lists more
than 2,900 packages available through Git.
