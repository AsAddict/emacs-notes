If REAL-BINDING is a symbol and has a non-`nil' `menu-enable'
 property, that property is an expression that controls whether the menu
 item is enabled. Every time the keymap is used to display a menu,
 Emacs evaluates the expression, and it enables the menu item only if
 the expression's value is non-`nil'. When a menu item is disabled, it
 is displayed in a “fuzzy” fashion, and cannot be selected.

How do I get the property of a symbol?
 (symbol-plist symbol)
