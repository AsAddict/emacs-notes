How do you file your notes under specific topics? Like all your
 short stories are under short stories, right? How does that work?

You can use remember-planner to quickly add notes to planner files.
 After setting up remember-planner according to the notes in
 remember-planner.el, use M-x remember to open a buffer for notes. It
 starts out with a link to the current buffer. After you type in your
 note, hit C-c C-c (remember-region). This prompts you for a planner
 page to associate the note with. By default, notes are added only to
 today's day page. However, if you specify something else
 ([[http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/ShortStories][ShortStories]], for
example), then the note is copied to that page. =)
