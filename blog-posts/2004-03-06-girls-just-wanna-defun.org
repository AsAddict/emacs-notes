Girls just wanna defun(1)
 I can't wake up, in the morning
 Cause of what I've been doing for most of the night.
 Teacher don't you know my program is done?
 And girls just wanna defun.

>

The phone rings, in the middle of the night
 Advisor screams, “Watcha gonna do with your life?”
 Patrick(2), how I relish double-oh-one(3)!
 And girls just wanna defun.

>

They just wanna, just wanna, yeah
 Girls just wanna defun.

>

Some people say
 A beautiful girl can't tool all night like
 The rest of the world.
 I wanna be the one to welcome the sun.
 And girls just wanna defun.
