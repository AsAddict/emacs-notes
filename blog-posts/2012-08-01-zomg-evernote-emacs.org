Update 2013-10-19: Check out
[[https://github.com/pymander/evernote-mode][https://github.com/pymander/evernote-mode]]
for a possibly better way to do things. =)

This is totally raw and needs a lot of hacking, but look, I can dump
subtrees from my Org notes into Evernote using
[[http://code.google.com/p/emacs-evernote-mode/][Emacs Evernote Mode]].
The desktop app handles these perfectly, although the Android app does
funny things to the whitespace if you edit the note. Still, great as a
reference!

Mwahahahaha!

In other news, I now have book notes from 156 books in my Evernote
notebook. Mwahahaha! Time to add more.
