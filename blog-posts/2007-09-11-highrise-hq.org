I took a look at [[http://www.highrisehq.com/][Highrise HQ]] following a
recommendation by Winston Damarillo. It's a web-based contact
relationship manager (CRM) by 37signals, so it's all pretty and Web
2.0-y.

Looking further, I'm surprised at how much my hand-hacked Emacs-based
CRM can do:

-  *Review a colleagueÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s notes before calling her contact at
   the printer* :: I do this with BBDB. Not only that, but my system
   automatically inserts notes into any e-mail I compose to that person.
-  *See all the follow-ups scheduled for this week* :: Got that with
   Planner
-  *Set a reminder to write your client a thank-you note next
   Friday* :: Ditto with Planner
-  *Keep all important emails from a customer together on one page* :: I
   suppose I could do that with mail search. There must be a better way,
   though...
-  *Schedule a follow-up sales call with a lead in 30 days* :: Gotcha.
-  *Review all communications with your investors* :: I haven't figured
   out how to do this one yet. Mail folders help. Maybe I can hook up
   BBDB with my mail search engine...
-  *Build a list of all the designers your company has hired in the
   past* :: Can do this with tags. In fact, I can build a list of people
   who are tagged with A but not B and whom I've talked to in the last
   year... =)
-  *Enter notes from a call with a potential client* :: Gotcha.
-  *Enter contact info for people you met at the conference this
   week* :: Gotcha.
-  *Generate a list of contractors you worked with last year* :: Gotcha.
-  *See all the people your company knows at The New York
   Times* :: Regexp search, easy enough.

Highrise: you can share your notes with other people. I don't need that
yet, and I don't think I'll need it any time soon.

Emacs: I can use it offline. That totally rocks. Also, I can do lots
 of complicated batch operations, such as composing form letters that
 include conditional text, randomized text, and personalized
 signatures. I can add arbitrary data fields and write code to do all
 sorts of things. I don't need Firefox or a mouse.

You know, if I just figured out how to translate my setup to the Web,
 I'd make a killing. ;)

I'm going to steal the idea of a pretty view, and I'm going to make it
 easier to see all the tasks associated with a person instead of
 relying on my daily view. I also need to make it easier to mark
 something as for-followup. Hmmm... But yeah, not too bad, not too
 bad...
