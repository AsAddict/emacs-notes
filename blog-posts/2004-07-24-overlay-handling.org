I finally figured out what was zapping my Japanese input on Planner
 pages: an overzealous extents+overlays zap in emacs-wiki. I read
 through a lot of the font-locking code and I think I'm beginning to
 understand how Emacs does it. Cool!

I've fixed it in emacs-wiki---dev and planner---dev. It seems to work
 over here. Hope no one else has problems!
