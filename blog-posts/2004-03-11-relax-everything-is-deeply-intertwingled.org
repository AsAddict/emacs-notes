I'm also interested in personal information management. Fisher sounds
 really cool, although naturally I'd need it to be open-source and
 Emacsable. I find that planner \_is\_ already changing my life,
changing
 my patterns for doing things. I like how it helps me manage my mail,
 keep my blog, search the bits and pieces I remembered.

Browsing through Adam Rifkin's entries, I think that he's someone I
 should learn from.

Incidentally, I have 115,729,742 bytes in my mail.misc now. That's
 mostly personal mail. I have 3,095,920 bytes in my ~/notebook/plans .
 That's my blog entries, schedules and tasks. =)
