If you're having problems with emacs-wiki not highlighting the first
 time you view a buffer, you're probably set to use jit-lock or
 lazy-lock. Don't. Use (setq font-lock-support-mode nil) instead, so
 full font-locking will always be performed. You may want to use the
 list so that this is only done for planner-mode and emacs-wiki-mode. =)
