Right after I finished setting up
[[http://www.plannerlove.com][plannerlove.com]] as a coming-of-age gift
to myself, I learned that
[[http://www.douglasjohnston.net/weblog/archives/2005/08/10/rebirthing/][Douglas
Johnston is making a website for do-it-yourself planners]]. Now Douglas
Johnston is one of my idols when it comes to organization, and his
D.I.Y. Planner series inspired me to go out there and start tweaking my
own forms. How can I beat that? Hugely popular, cohesive set of
templates, a wiki to support his blog's community... waah. It's enough
to make a just-turned-22 girl feel small. But hey, maybe I can still do
soft goal analysis---must think of a good way to organize that---and if
all else fails, I can always use plannerlove to gush about
