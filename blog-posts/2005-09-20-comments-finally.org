After receiving so many helpful and caring comments regarding my
breathing post
 (eat well, get plenty of rest, etc.), and seeing wonderful well-thought
discussion over at [[http://clair.free.net.ph/174][Clair's blog]], I
finally got motivated enough to hack dynamic comments into Planner.

[[http://www.haloscan.com][Haloscan]] made it a piece of cake! Search
for the segment on “Permalinks and comments” in
[[http://sachachua.com/notebook/emacs/planner-config.el][../emacs/planner-config.el]]
to see the actual code.

So please introduce yourself in the comments to this entry, and see
 who else reads this blog! =) Who are you? What are you interested in?
 How did you find out about this blog? (How on earth do you put up with
 my rambling? =) )
