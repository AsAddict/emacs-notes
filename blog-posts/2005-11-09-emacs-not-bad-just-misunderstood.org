#+TITLE: Emacs: Not bad, just misunderstood

People love dissing the Emacs text editor. Emacs is one of those
 arcane things that even \_geeks\_ aren't expected to understand. It's
 probably the canonical example of a tool built for geeks by geeks:
 hard to use, hard to understand, hard to just pick up and play with.

I really don't think Emacs is bad. It's just misunderstood, the way
 mainstream people think Linux is bad because it's all command-line
 when the truth is that Linux is so much more than that. Emacs is so
 much more than what people think it is, but people just settle for the
 quick sound bite.

As Alex Schroeder (kensanata) blogged:

| 23:29   | kensanata   | eek. on creating happy programmers, quote: As Nat Torkington explained to me in his non-politically-correct but useful way, “It's no longer aspergers and emacs... we're putting people back into the equation.”   |
| 23:29   | kensanata   | aspergers and emacs ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ that the social niche we live in.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 23:29   | hober       | yeah                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 23:29   | hober       | kensanata: I'm going to blog about that tonight                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 23:30   | e1f         | you have aspergers?                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 23:30   | kensanata   | no, i have emacs.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
