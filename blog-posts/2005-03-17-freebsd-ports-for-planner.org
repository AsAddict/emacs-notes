  I've got emacs-wiki, planner, and remember in the FreeBSD ports
   tree. Now FreeBSD users can install these all by

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      cd /usr/ports/deskutils/remember.el
      make install clean
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  And turn on the “planner support” in the menu.

  Thank you all for making this great software!
