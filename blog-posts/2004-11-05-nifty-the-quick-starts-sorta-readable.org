[[http://www.livejournal.com/users/eclair/][Clair]] has
 started playing around with Emacs and Planner. She found the

start]]
 useful. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!

Clair: A basic Planner should automatically pick up filenames from the
 current buffer unless you're on a date page. Try using
 planner-create-task-from-buffer from another plan page or from a file
 on your hard disk. If that doesn't do something interesting, please
 e-mail me. =) Have fun!
