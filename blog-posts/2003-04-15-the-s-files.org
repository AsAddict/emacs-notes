If it wasn't obvious by now, the
[[http://richip.dhs.org/mailman/listinfo/sfiles][SFiles]] mailing
 list is pretty dead. I'll be merging those into my planner archive
 Really Soon. =)

So, Dominique Cimafranca, rest assured that the messages in the
 [[http://richip.dhs.org/mailman/listinfo/sfiles][SFiles]] archives --
and this website -- are meant for public
 consumption. If you're into browsing through other people's mail,
 might I recommend Griffin and Sabine by Nick Bantock? ;)
