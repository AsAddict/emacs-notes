#+TITLE: Emacs: Jump to anything

I just came across the
[[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Anything][Anything]] extension
for Emacs. After you load anything.el, you can type M-x anything RET and
a substring of, well, anything. Looks like a handy shortcut. It's like
Quicksilver, but for Emacs. Grab
[[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/download/anything-config.el][anything-config.el]]
for a bunch of useful functions.

Here's my current configuration:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (require 'anything)
    (require 'anything-config)
    (setq anything-sources
          (list anything-c-source-buffers
                anything-c-source-file-name-history
                anything-c-source-info-pages
                anything-c-source-man-pages
            anything-c-source-file-cache
                anything-c-source-emacs-commands))
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-X") 'anything)
#+END_EXAMPLE
