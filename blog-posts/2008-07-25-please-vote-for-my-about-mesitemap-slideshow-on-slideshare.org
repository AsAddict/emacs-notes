Only 7 days left for the *Slideshare World's Best Presentation Contest,*
and I'd love it if y'all came out and voted for
[[http://www.slideshare.net/sachac/hello-im-sacha-chua/][my about-me
presentation]]--if only because I found a way to fit both *Drupal* and
*Emacs* into my rhyming self-introduction! =)

It's only one minute and 25 seconds, and it'll probably make you smile.
Plus, it's a (mostly) working sitemap, and how cool is that? ;) The
prize for this category is an iPod Touch, which (if I win it) I will
promptly put to good use. After all, if I used my Nintendo DS to make a
presentation, what might I do with something like the iPod Touch? ;)

Honorable mention would get me a copy of Presentation Zen book, which I
liked so much I bought it already, so I'd be happy to raffle it off and
keep just the warm and fuzzy feelings that my fledgling sketching and
writing skills got noticed. Want it? Leave a comment on this entry (just
one comment is fine), and I'll pick a random commenter if I win the
book.

In addition to either blog posts about doing interesting things with the
iPod Touch or a chance at winning a free book, you'll also get the
satisfaction of supporting a geek in an area dominated by graphic
designers. =) (Not that graphic designers can't be geeks, of course.)

Anyway, please vote for my presentation! =) Voting ends on July 31,
2008.
