The next thing I wanted to do was get into Emacs Lisp. I ended up
 contributing to Emacs Relay Chat and helping out with Planner and
 related modules.

Now I think I want to be more into Ruby. And Perl 6, which looks
 awesome. Maybe I can practice technical writing by filling in the
 documentation and writing sample code...
