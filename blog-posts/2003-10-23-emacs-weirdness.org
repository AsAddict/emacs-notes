For some reason, local-write-file-hooks had the BBDB stuff in it, so
 cookies were getting added to my data...

Hmm. Test script.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((old-hook local-write-file-hooks))
        (with-temp-buffer (add-hook 'local-write-file-hooks 'foo))
        (unless (equal local-write-file-hooks old-hook)
          (error "Failed test. local-write-file-hooks was modified in this buffer."))
        ;; Let's put things back the way they were
        (setq-default local-write-file-hooks old-hook))
#+END_EXAMPLE
