The following code allows you to sort tasks based on regexp matches
 against the line. It's fairly simple, but may give people ideas about
 fancier task sorting.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq planner-sort-tasks-key-function 'planner-sort-tasks-by-score)

    (defvar planner-score-rules '(("read" . 50))
      "Alist of planner scoring rules of the form (regexp . score-value).
    Tasks with higher scores are listed first.")

    (defun planner-sort-tasks-by-score ()
      "Sort tasks by the rule in the table."
      (let ((score 0)
            (case-fold-search t)
            (line (buffer-substring-no-properties (line-beginning-position)
                                                  (line-end-position))))
        (mapc
         (lambda (item)
           (when (string-match (car item) line)
             (setq score (- score (cdr item)))))
         planner-score-rules)
        score))
