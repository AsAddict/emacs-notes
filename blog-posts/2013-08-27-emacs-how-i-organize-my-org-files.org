/Michael Jones wanted to know how I organized my Org Mode files. Here's
how I do things!/

[[http://orgmode.org][Org Mode for Emacs]] is an outliner that lets you
add a little structure to plain text files. Not only can you use it to
move around, hide, and show sections of your outline, but you can also:

-  schedule tasks and mark them as complete,
-  add hyperlinks and formatting,
-  estimate effort and track time,
-  export to HTML and other formats,
-  and even include code that you can run in-line.

I started with a single Org Mode file (appropriately called
organizer.org), but I've gradually fleshed this out into a number of
files. My goals for organizing my files this way are to be able to:

-  Publish some files while keeping other files private,
-  Add or remove groups of tasks from my agenda, or focus my
   agenda/search on the current file,
-  Simplify processing my weekly review (categorizing
   accomplishments/tasks),
-  Get a quick overview of important things, and
-  Have file-specific options, like columns.

I often use [[http://sachachua.com/blog/dotemacs#agenda_commands][Org
agenda custom commands]] to jump around. For example, one agenda command
lists projects, and pressing RET on an agenda line will take me to that
project. I also use =org-capture= to take a note from anywhere, and I
use =org-goto= to navigate my files. For jumping to a specific file, I
use =ido-find-file=.

I use several Org Mode files. The six files below have a little more
than 1.3MB of text in total -- tiny! -- but they help me tremendously. I
also have lots of other Org files like my
[[http://sachachua.com/blog/dotemacs][Emacs configuration]] and
[[http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3968124/blog.html][my blog index]]
(I often use Org for publishing), but these are my main files.

*Personal tasks and notes: organizer.org*

This is the catch-all for any tasks or notes that don't belong to the
files below. Here's the rough structure:

-  *Quick notes:* Tidbits that might not make it into their own blog
   posts, but which can be included in weekly reviews
-  *Reference:* Hours, license keys, etc.
-  *Open loops:* Anything I need to check on every so often
-  *Projects:* High-level things I'm focusing on
-  *Financial goals:* Things to save up for
-  *Someday/maybe:* Projects to do someday
-  *Weekly review:* Divided by year
-  *Monthly review:* More summaries
-  *Plans:* Personal plans
-  *2011, 2012, 2013...*: I use org-capture to quickly jot down notes.
   The datetree option automatically files them by day, which makes
   older ones easier to archive.
-  *Tasks:* A bucket for miscellaneous tasks

*Anything to do with business: business.org*

I organize these by the types of tasks I focus on and the notes I want
to keep.

-  Earn

   -  Clients
   -  Leads

-  Build

   -  Projects
   -  Research
   -  Business ideas
   -  Blog
   -  Delegation
   -  Planning
   -  Business hygiene (accounting, etc.)
   -  Learning

-  Connect

   -  Meetups
   -  Hangouts
   -  Other

-  Reference
-  Tasks

*Relationships: people.org*

I organize these by relationships so that I can remember who's out
there.

-  Family
-  Extended family
-  Canada friends
-  Hacklab
-  Barkada
-  Letters
-  Meetups
-  Bloggers
-  Family friends
-  Other tasks

*Regular tasks: routines.org*

I organize these by frequency and omit the tasks from my weekly review.
This also contains my “In case of...” scenarios and my backup
documentation.

-  Every day
-  Once a week
-  Once a month
-  Once a quarter
-  Once a year
-  When...

*Outline for future blog posts:*
[[http://sach.ac/outline][sharing/index.org]]

I organize this by topic. See
[[http://sach.ac/outline][http://sach.ac/outline]] for the published
version

*Decision review: decisions.org*

I organize these by status. I also use org-choose markers (ex: CHOSEN,
MAYBE) inside the categories, but the headings make it easier to review.

-  Pending
-  Current
-  For review
-  Someday / maybe
-  Archive

*Personal finance: ledger.org*

I use [[http://www.ledger-cli.org/][John Wiegley's command-line Ledger
program]] to manage my finances. My financial data is in separate
ledger-mode files, and I use an Org file with org-babel to make it
easier for me to answer some questions about my finances. For example:

-  Given my average monthly expenses and the amount of money I've set
   aside, how long can I sustain my early-retirement experiment?
-  Am I ahead or behind in terms of household contributions?
-  What did I spend on last month?
-  Are my virtual envelopes balanced?

*How do you organize your Org files or outlines?*

Everyone's got different ways of organizing outlines, and people also
also change over time. How do you organize yours?
