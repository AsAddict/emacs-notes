I guess most of my readers (Hi Mom!) check this site once a day, or
 something like that. They read from top to bottom.

So why am I using reverse-chronological order?

Good thing it's easy to (setq planner-reverse-chronological-notes nil).

(setq planner-reverse-chronological-notes t) is recommended for sites
 that have lots of updates and people checking back every five minutes.
 My site isn't like that, so we might as well make the site structure
 follow the structure in our minds.

Okay. Everyone, time flows forward again.
