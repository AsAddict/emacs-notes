I've written a totally small-time presentation thingy that cues me
thanks to Emacspeak. ;) Here's the setup code:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (progn ;; Setup
      (defvar democamp/presentation-file "~/democamp.el")
      (defvar democamp/cue-buffer "*DemoCamp*")
      (defun democamp/next ()
        (interactive)
        (let (start sexp)
          (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect democamp/presentation-file)
            (setq start (point))
            (forward-sexp)
            (setq sexp (buffer-substring-no-properties start (point))))
          (eval (read sexp))))

      (defun democamp/previous ()
        (interactive)
        (let (start sexp)
          (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect democamp/presentation-file)
            (setq start (point))
            (backward-sexp)
            (setq sexp (buffer-substring-no-properties (point) start)))
          (eval (read sexp))))

      (defun democamp/repeat ()
        (interactive)
        (let (start sexp)
          (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect democamp/presentation-file)
            (setq start (point))
            (backward-sexp)
            (setq sexp (buffer-substring (point) start))
            (forward-sexp))
          (eval (read sexp))))

      (defun democamp/say (text)
        (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create democamp/cue-buffer)
          (erase-buffer)
          (insert text)
          (goto-char (point-min))
          (call-interactively 'emacspeak-speak-buffer)))
      (global-set-key (kbd "") 'democamp/next)
      (global-set-key (kbd "S-") 'democamp/previous)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-") 'democamp/repeat)
    )
