The following code snippet makes it easier for me to import segments
 from my dictionary files. It uses
[[http://sachachua.com/notebook/emacs/flashcard.el][../emacs/flashcard.el]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun flashcard-import-from-kill (deck)
      "Import cards for DECK from the clipboard, which should be colon-separated.

    Question : Answer"
      (interactive (list flashcard-deck))
      (unless (eq major-mode 'flashcard-mode)
        (error "You're not in a deckfile."))
      (with-temp-buffer
        (yank)
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (while (re-search-forward "^ *\\(.*\\) +: +\\(.*\\)$" nil t)
          (flashcard-add-card deck
                              (flashcard-make-card (match-string 1)
                                                   (match-string 2)))))
      (when (and (interactive-p)
                 (not flashcard-card))
        (flashcard-ask)))
