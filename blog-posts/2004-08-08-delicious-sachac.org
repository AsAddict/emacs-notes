[[http://del.icio.us/sachac][http://del.icio.us/sachac]]: My del.icio.us
page. New URLs will be
 posted there instead of on this blog, because blogging to del.icio.us
 is slightly more fun than posting to planner. I should still find some
 way of blogging URLs to both here and del.icio.us, because it's fun to
 be able to search offline. Oh well.
