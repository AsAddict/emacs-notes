I used xtla to browse my TLA archives today. xtla's bookmarks and
 missing patch summary made merging missing patches much easier. I used
 m to mark interesting patches and . r to replay
 the marked patches. Great stuff.

In related news, I'll really need to migrate the archive. At 98414
 characters, our ChangeLog is now 1/5 of the size of the source code
 (457478 bytes). Dev's changelog is much bigger---147672 bytes.
