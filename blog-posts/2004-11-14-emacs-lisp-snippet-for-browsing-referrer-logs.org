#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun sacha/ffap-quick ()
      (interactive)
      (save-window-excursion
        (save-excursion
          (ffap))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This makes browsing the output of ref.pl (previously blogged; it just
 extracts the referrer) much easier. I local-set-key it to RET. Hitting
 RET twice opens the URL as a w3m tab in the background.
