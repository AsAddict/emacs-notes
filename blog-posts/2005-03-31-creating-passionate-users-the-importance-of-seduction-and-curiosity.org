  Part of creating passionate users starts with building curiosity.
  Inspire them to want to learn, know, and do more.

I love making people curious about things, whether it's Emacs,
 Planner, computer science, or even far-out stuff like street
 performance.

Kathy Sierra gives these tips:

1. Be passionately curious yourself.
2. Be seductive.
3. Make them curious by doing something unusual, without an obvious
   explanation.
4. Offer a puzzle or interesting question... without giving them the
   solution.

*Be passionately curious yourself.* Heck yeah. I love learning
 about things. When people give me feedback on my talk, the first thing
 that usually comes to their mind is my enthusiasm for the topic. Even
 when I can't go into a lot of detail about something like Squeak, they
 pick up on the fact that I think it's really interesting and something
 worth being curious about.

*Be seductive.* I often do my Planner help that way when the
 person I'm talking to expresses interest in learning Lisp. I'll take
 them partway to a solution and leave enough for them to figure things
 out. Even with the hacks we put together for Planner, there's always
 that tantalizing glimpse of what \_else\_ could be possible.

*Make them curious by doing something unusual, without an obvious
 explanation.* This is why I've taken to starting my Knoppix
 presentations with a Windows display. ;)

*Offer a puzzle or interesting question... without giving them the
 solution.* Oooh, still have to figure out how to do this one
 properly.

Fun.
