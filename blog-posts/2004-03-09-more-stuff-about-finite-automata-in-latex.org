  I had exactly this issue when I was tutoring a group of Computability
   Theory students. I found that only GNU Pic gave good results. You can
   embed pic inline in LaTeX documents and have it render properly but
   it's probably better results to use a Makefile and run pic/groff to
   get EPS files.
