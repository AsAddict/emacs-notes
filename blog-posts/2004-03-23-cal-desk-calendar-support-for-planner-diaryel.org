  Hi all,

  I patched what I hope is the most recent version of planner-diary.el
   from tla to optionally utilize cal-desk-calendar. cal-desk-calendar
   is an add-on for diary-mode which displays the day's events in a neat
   “desk calendar” like way. I wanted to be able to have this pulled
   into my day planner pages instead of just a list of the scheduled
   event. To do this, I added a variable
  ‘planner-diary-use-cal-desk-calendar',
   which when set to non-nil will cause cal-desk-calendar to be used. I
   patched planner-diary-get-diary-entries to handle this.

  A screenshot of this in action:

  My changed planner-diary.el:

  My elisp skills aren't the greatest, so I'm open for corrections or
   enhancements. I hope others can find this as useful as I have.
