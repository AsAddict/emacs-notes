[[http://orgmode.org][Org mode for Emacs]] is powerful and flexible,
which can make it intimidating for newcomers. After helping several
people with essentially the same problem--an unmanageably large heap of
tasks--I thought about what might help people get the hang of the key
features of Org Mode slowly.

Here are some general ideas. Start by writing your tasks down. Group
them into projects. Once you get the hang of that, schedule your tasks.
You might find yourself overestimating what you can do in a day, so
reschedule or get rid of tasks as needed.

Here's a visual overview of how you can apply that to Org, starting with
simple outlines and moving on to scheduling.
