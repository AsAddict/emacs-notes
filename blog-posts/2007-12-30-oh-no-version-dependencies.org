#+TITLE: Oh no! Version dependencies...

2I really want to share my code for reviewing Org timeclock entries for
each date. However, it depends on functionality that's only in the
development version of Org. Do I tell people to change to that version?
Do I try to make it work with the standard version that comes with
Emacs? And the development version of Org comes with all sorts of nice
goodies, too...

Okay, I figured out what to do. I'm going to include it, but I'll use a
distinctive background to show people that this is only available with a
newer version of Org. That way, the bleeding edge geeks can still do all
sorts of cool stuff.
