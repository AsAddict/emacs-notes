This snippet helps me keep track of what I'm supposed to be doing.
 I've bound it to F9 F9. Calling it with C-u brings me to the planner
 page so that I can complete the current task or look at the context.
 F9 F9 from that page will restore my window configuration.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defvar sacha/window-register "w"
      "Register for jumping back and forth between planner and wherever I am.")
    (defvar sacha/planner-current-task nil
      "Current task info.")
    (defadvice planner-task-in-progress (after sacha activate)
      "Keep track of the task info."
      (setq sacha/planner-current-task (planner-current-task-info)))

    (defun sacha/planner-what-am-i-doing (&optional prefix)
      "Make it easy to keep track of what I'm supposed to be working on.
    If PREFIX is non-nil, jump to the current task, else display it
    in a message. If called from the plan page, jump back to whatever
    I was looking at."
      (interactive "P")
      (if planner-timeclock-current-task
          (if (string= (planner-task-page sacha/planner-current-task)
                       (planner-page-name))
              (jump-to-register sacha/window-register)
            (if (null prefix)
                (message planner-timeclock-current-task)
              (frame-configuration-to-register sacha/window-register)
              (planner-find-file (planner-task-page sacha/planner-current-task))
              (planner-find-task sacha/planner-current-task)))
        (if prefix
            (planner-goto-today)
          (message "No current task. HEY!"))))
