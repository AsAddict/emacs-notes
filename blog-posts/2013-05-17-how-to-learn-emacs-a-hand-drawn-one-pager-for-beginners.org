Original post from May 2013:
[[file:uploads/2013/05/How-to-Learn-Emacs8.png][
]]I thought I'd draw a one-page guide for some of the things that people
often ask me about or that would help people learn Emacs (and enjoy it).
You can click on the image for a larger version that you can scroll
through or download. It should print all right on 8.5×11″ paper
(landscape) if you want to keep it around as a reminder. Might even work
at 11×17″. =)

Possibly counterintuitive point: It's good to learn at least the basics
of Vim. Despite the perception of a “Emacs vs. Vi” holy war (one of the
classic battles in computer science), it makes sense to know both
editors especially if you work with people who use Vi a lot. Know enough
Vi to find your way around, and then learn how to customize Emacs to fit
you to a tee. That way, you'll avoid the pressure of not being able to
work well with your team or your infrastructure, and you'll have the
space to explore Emacs. =) Emacs is totally awesome.

Need help with Emacs? Feel free to leave a comment or [[http://sachachua.com/blog/contact][get in touch
with me]]. I'm often in the #emacs channel on irc.freenode.net , and I
also occasionally schedule time to [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2013/04/emacs-chat-intro/][help people one-on-one]]. Also, the
Emacs community (mailing lists, newsgroups, IRC channel) can be
wonderful, so definitely reach out to them too. =)

/Meta discussion:/ How can I make this even better? What else would
you like me to draw a guide for? I'd love to hear your thoughts! Also,
thanks to dash, nicferrier, fledermaus, ijp, hypnocat, Fuco, macrobat,
taylanub, axrfnu, Sebboh, thorkill, jave\_, jrm, and the rest of
#emacs for suggestions and feedback!
