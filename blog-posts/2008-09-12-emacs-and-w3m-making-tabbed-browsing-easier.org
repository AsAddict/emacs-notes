#+TITLE: Emacs and w3m: Making tabbed browsing easier

If you browse with a lot of open tabs, like I do, w3m will be much
easier to use once you remap =w3m-next-buffer= and =w3m-previous-buffer=
onto single-key shortcuts, allowing you to press a key to quickly flip
between tabs.

By default, =w3m-previous-buffer= is mapped to C-c C-p and
=w3m-next-buffer= is mapped to C-c C-n. On a QWERTY keyboard, you may
want to remap =w3m-previous-buffer= to q and =w3m-next-buffer= to w.
You'll probably also want to remap =w3m-close-window= (which had been
bound to q), and x is a good keybinding for that. To make all these
changes, add the following to your /~/.emacs/:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (eval-after-load 'w3m
      '(progn
         (define-key w3m-mode-map "q" 'w3m-previous-buffer)
         (define-key w3m-mode-map "w" 'w3m-next-buffer)
         (define-key w3m-mode-map "x" 'w3m-close-window)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you use a Dvorak keyboard layout, you can bind . to
=w3m-previous-buffer= and , to =w3m-next-buffer= instead. Just add the
following code to your /~/.emacs/:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (eval-after-load 'w3m
      '(progn
         (define-key w3m-mode-map "." 'w3m-previous-buffer)
         (define-key w3m-mode-map "," 'w3m-next-buffer)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

(This is part of the draft for my
[[http://sachachua.com/wp/category/wickedcoolemacs][book on Emacs]], to
be published by No Starch Press if I'm not too late.)
