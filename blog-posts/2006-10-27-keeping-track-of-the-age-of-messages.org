#+TITLE: Keeping track of the age of messages

I can get pretty bad at responding to e-mail. This is an experiment to
 see whether the negative reinforcement of seeing just how old a
 message is will help me be more responsive. Either that, or I can
 strive for a Mean Time Between Responses of whatever... ;)

Hmm, maybe I should combine this with my blog and start distinguishing
 between E-mail to and Reply to...

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defadvice gnus-post-news (around sacha/gnus-track-message-age activate)
      "Insert a header showing how old a message is, to shame me into replying faster."
      ;; Before you post the news, figure out how old it is
      (let (days)
        (when article-buffer
          (setq days
                (- (time-to-days (current-time))
                   (time-to-days
                    (gnus-date-get-time
                     (mail-header-date
                      (gnus-summary-article-header
                       (gnus-summary-article-number))))))))
        ad-do-it
        (when days
          (goto-char (point-min))
          (when (re-search-forward "--text follows this line--" nil t)
            (forward-line 1)
            (insert "In reply to a message sent by "
                    (mail-header-from message-reply-headers)
                    " "
                    (cond
                     ((= days 0) "today")
                     ((= days 1) "yesterday")
                     (t (format "%d days ago" days)))
                    ": \n\n")))))
    (setq message-citation-line-function nil)
