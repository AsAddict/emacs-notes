#+TITLE: ri-mode bug when there is no current word

I replaced the stock implementation of ruby-default-ri-entry with the
 following code so that I could use it even if I didn't have a current
 word.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun ruby-default-ri-entry ()
      (let (word)
        (save-excursion
          (setq word (or (current-word) ""))
          (if (string-match "[._]+$" word)
          (setq word (substring word 0 (match-beginning 0))))
          (format "%s%s"
              word
              ""))))
#+END_EXAMPLE
