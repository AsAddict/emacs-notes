- A list of all the notes related to a BBDB contact. I'd have to parse

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  out all the bbdb links, covert them into canonical names and match
   them against the records, but it would be fun.

- General emacs-wiki hyperlinks.

- Recurring tasks.

- Ongoing projects and the next task in them. Upon task completion,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  the next task in the project would be scheduled. Actually, this is
   already handled by future tasks, but this flexibility might be fun.
   Forces you to think of the next step.
#+END_QUOTE

- Monthly headlines in a calendar.

- Notes index by month, by year.

- timeclock integration into my Schedule.
