dto on #emacs suggested a way to create tasks associated with planner
pages.
 Arch repository and dev snapshot should have working version of this.

Adding a prefix argument to M-x planner-create-task-from-buffer will
 make it prompt for the plan page. If the plan page is different from
 the current annotation, it will move the annotation into the
 description of the task. Any other suggestions? =)
