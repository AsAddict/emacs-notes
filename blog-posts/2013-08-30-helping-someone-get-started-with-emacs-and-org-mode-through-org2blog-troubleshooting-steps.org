[[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][Org2Blog]] is an awesome
geek-friendly way of writing posts and publishing them to a
WordPress-based blog. When [[http://christopherolah.com][Christopher
Olah]] told me that he'd gotten convinced to try Org Mode thanks to the
enthusiastic recommendations from
[[http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/michael-a-nielsen/][Michael Nielsen]]
and me, we figured that getting him sorted out with taking notes in Org
and publishing them through Org2Blog to his WordPress.com-hosted blog
would be an excellent way to start -- especially with inline images and
LaTeX.

Chris has promised to write a blog post about what he's learned, but
he'll probably find these notes useful. Here's what we ran into when
getting org2blog working on Ubuntu.

*Need to install the files and set up the load paths*

We downloaded the following and added them to an =~/.elisp= directory

-  [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog]]
-  [[https://github.com/punchagan/metaweblog.el][https://github.com/punchagan/metaweblog.el]]
-  [[https://launchpad.net/xml-rpc-el][https://launchpad.net/xml-rpc-el]]

We also set up his =~/.init.d/emacs.el= to load the libraries, set the
blog list, and load =ido-mode= and =icomplete-mode=.

*Emacs / Org too old*

Metaweblog and Org2blog didn't work well with Emacs 23 and Org 6. We
upgraded to Emacs 24 with =apt-get install emacs24= in order to get Org
7.

*Can't find library org*

It turns out that you also need to =apt-get install emacs24-el= in order
to include those libraries.

*Org still too old for org2blog*

We were having some problems with the version detection of org2blog, so
we replaced the org2blog he downloaded with the version I forked at
[[https://github.com/sachac/org2blog][https://github.com/sachac/org2blog]]
, which I've been using with Org 7.

Then we tested it with =org2blog/wp-post-subtree=, and that worked.
Inline images with =org-toggle-inline-images= worked too, yay!

Next step: viewing LaTeX fragments, since Chris does a lot of math.

*dvipng required*

=org-preview-latex-fragment= wanted dvipng to be installed, so we
=apt-get install dvipng=.

*LaTeX fragment preview showed blank images*

We looked at the =*Messages*= buffer and found that the =.tex= files in
=/tmp= could not be rendered by =dvipng= because =marvosym.sty= could
not be found. We fixed that with
=apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended.=

(Doing this on my own, I found that I also needed
=apt-get install texlive-latex-extra= .)

... and then we could see *and publish* LaTeX fragments, which was
awesome. =D

*WordPress.com double-interpreted LaTeX fragments*

Chris was having problems with LaTeX fragments when
=org-export-with-LaTeX-fragments= was set to dvipng. It turns out that
WordPress.com also interprets LaTeX, so it was getting confused by the
alt tags. To solve this, use M-x customize
org-export-with-LaTeX-fragmentsand choose =Leave math verbatim=. Then
the LaTeX fragments are passed to WordPress, which renders them as PNGs.

Hope that helps!
