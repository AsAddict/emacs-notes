Glad to say that students get to seriously work with Linux in Ateneo -
 you can thank Horatio Bogbindero and Dr. Manalastas for that! =)

Never underestimate the importance of playing. I play with Emacs all the
time,
 and I learn something new every day.

(Incidentally, I should also figure out this trackback thing... I wonder
if emacs-wiki.el can handle that.)
