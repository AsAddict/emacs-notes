I guess that satisfies my exercise quota. ;)

I wanted to get started in screen printing and decorating. I \_could\_
 hand it off to someone to mass-produce, but I've got quirky ideas that
 would probably make learning how to do it myself pay off.

I bought a screen printing kit and I'll be making shirts for myself.
 I'll also make a special [[http://www.diyplanner.com][D*I*Y Planner]]
shirt for Doug. =)
 And if I really like it, I'll play around with other designs...

I also bought some canvas so that I can make my own patches. I want a
 D*I*Y logo on my bag. Or a geek logo. Hmmm. Maybe I can do something
 to make the patches hotswappable...

I'm tired! I'm not going to make the shirts today. I'm going to rest a
 bit and then work on my lab report so I have something to show
 tomorrow. =) I'll do the shirts tomorrow night.
