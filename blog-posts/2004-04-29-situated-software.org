I think this is why I have so much fun working on
[[http://sachachua.com/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode][PlannerMode]]. I have
 a clearly-defined set of users in mind (mostly the mailing list) and I
 love threshing out interfaces and features with them. It's not a
 large-scale application and it certainly doesn't appeal to the masses,
 but it can be quite powerful when you get the hang of it.

Hey, Emacs is like that too. =)

Open source supports situated software very well, as you can tweak
 something existing in order to fit your needs.

By the way, the author taught a class called Social Software.

Must forward to Dr. Rodrigo. This is her kind of thing.
