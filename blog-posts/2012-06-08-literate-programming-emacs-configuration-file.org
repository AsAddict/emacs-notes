/Update 2013-08-30: Changed Emacs Starter Kit link. Thanks, Thomas!/

Inspired by the [[http://eschulte.github.io/emacs-starter-kit/][Emacs
Starter Kit]] and the literate programming features in
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org-babel]], I reviewed
and organized my
[[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3968124/sacha-emacs.html][Emacs
configuration]]. I'm looking forward to adding more notes to my
configuration as I explore!

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Literate
programming]] is the idea that you should write first and program
second, and that you can interweave the program into your explanation.
Nifty.

configuration]] (you can also find it at
