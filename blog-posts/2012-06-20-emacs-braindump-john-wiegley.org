I'm going to edit and post my Skype chat with John Wiegley, but here are
some quick notes:

-  Read Emacswiki and go through the package lists to find cool stuff
-  Learn the Emacs way of doing things (keybindings, etc.)
-  paredit
-  redshank
-  helm
-  ace-jump
-  color-moccur
-  use-package
-  async?

Looks like Camtasia Studio 8 grabbed the video just fine, so I'll work
on editing it tomorrow. Whee! I totally have to chat with other Emacs
geeks about their config and their projects -- it's such a different
experience from just reading people's configuration files or chatting on
IRC...
