  using Emacs on Macosx myself, I can tell you that emacs 21.2.1 comes
   with macosx. If you want a more recent version, you can just checkout
   the CVS-Emacs and cd mac; ./make-package ---self-contained to get an
   installable macosx-app that plays nice with planner.

  btw.: a .dmg file is mounted by double-clicking it ;-)

Ooooh, nifty. I wonder if it comes with pretty widgets. I want my mom
 to have a menubar right away. <grin>

Thanks for the tip!
