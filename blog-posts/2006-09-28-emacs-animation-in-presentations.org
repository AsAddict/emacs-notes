... and because this is just so endearingly old-school and crazily
 Emacs, here's what's going to be my title “slide” for DemoCamp10.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (progn
      (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 700)
      (delete-other-windows)
      (sit-for 1)
      (animate-sequence (list "Livin' la Vida Emacs" "DemoCamp10" "Sacha Chua") 1))
#+END_EXAMPLE

I may end up writing a presentation mode if there isn't one yet. I've
 seen one before, but I don't know if it accepts arbitrary Lisp
 expressions. Maybe I can mess around with eev, too..

  OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's just SOOOOOO cool, and hysterical. I've got
   to steal\^H\^H\^H\^H\^Hborrow this hack. I've been toying with the
  idea
   for a while of doing a “Life with Emacs” talk for my LUG. What a
   perfect opening :)
