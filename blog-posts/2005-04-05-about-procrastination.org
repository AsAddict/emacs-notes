From [[http://www.dictionary.com][http://www.dictionary.com]] :

pro-cras-ti-nate

(v. intr.) To put off doing something, especially out of habitual
carelessness or laziness.

(v. tr.) To postpone or delay needlessly.

*Procrastination* might not be the best word to advertise so
 prominently on the wikiblog of *personal information management*
 software maintainer, what with all its negative connotations. After
 all, don't we want software to help us be more productive, not less?

So what's with *planned procrastination*, anyway? I renamed my
 blog from the informative-but-boring “sacha chua -- wiki” to the
 huh?-and-slightly-less-boring “planned procrastination” on a whim. I
 wanted to mention some kind of planning, but I didn't want to project
 myself as some kind of productivity guru. At least, not yet.

Besides, what's wrong with the word “procrastination”? I joke about
 [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerMode][PlannerMode]]
 being the best procrastination tool I've ever used. When I think about
 it, though, *that's* why I like it so much. Planner doesn't force
 a particular way of thinking on me. It doesn't bury me under a list of
 urgent TODOs that must! be! done! today! Planner simply lets me get
 things out of my head so that I can rest assured knowing that things I
 plan to do someday won't slip through the cracks of my memory.

Sure, a lot of self-help books tell you to *stop procrastinating and
 do things now.* I might be one of the rare people *not*
 bothered by the idea that I procrastinate. I keep ideas simmering on
 the backburner, ready for lazy afternoons or moments of inspiration in
 the bath. My procrastination is a gleeful exercise of power over my
 life, making space for other unplanned things. I don't mind putting
 things off until tomorrow if there are unexpectedly wonderful things
 going on today. =)

Note that this doesn't mean I'll put off doing things until the
 absolute last minute. In fact, I enjoy doing things with time limits
 as soon as I can, and I often submitted programming assignments soon
 after they were given. I once majorly freaked out when one of my group
 projects was delayed not because of my part (which I had finished
 weeks before) but because the other group members hadn't even started
 on their documentation until the day before (or something like
 that)...

For me, procrastination is simply the ability to choose what I'd like
 to work on today, knowing that I can work on other things tomorrow or
 the next day or the day after that. It's not perfect, but it does give
 me a happy feeling about how much I accomplish each day and excitement
 about what I'm going to do tomorrow.

I'm looking for a stronger title. “productively procrastinating”?
 “structured procrastination”? Something that doesn't mention
 procrastinating but still manages to express this idea? =) Any
 suggestions?
