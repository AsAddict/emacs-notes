#+TITLE: Emacs and W3M: Toggling between work and the Web

Here's a handy shortcut that toggles between the W3M web browser and
other buffers you're working on. I use it to quickly switch between code
and documentation (or your favorite timewasting site, as it also makes a
handy boss key).

Define the function by adding the following code to your ~/.emacs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun wicked/toggle-w3m ()
      "Switch to a w3m buffer or return to the previous buffer."
      (interactive)
      (if (derived-mode-p 'w3m-mode)
          ;; Currently in a w3m buffer
          ;; Bury buffers until you reach a non-w3m one
          (while (derived-mode-p 'w3m-mode)
        (bury-buffer))
        ;; Not in w3m
        ;; Find the first w3m buffer
        (let ((list (buffer-list)))
          (while list
        (if (with-current-buffer (car list)
              (derived-mode-p 'w3m-mode))
            (progn
              (switch-to-buffer (car list))
              (setq list nil))
          (setq list (cdr list))))
          (unless (derived-mode-p 'w3m-mode)
        (call-interactively 'w3m)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then bind it to a shortcut key sequence (F7 F7 in this example) by
adding the following code to your ~/.emacs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (global-set-key (kbd " ") 'wicked/toggle-w3m)
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can then use F7 F7 to switch back and forth between your web browser
and whatever else you're working on.
