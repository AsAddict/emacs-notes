The tips Joseph Miklojcik shared for
[[http://jfm3-repl.blogspot.com/2007/12/emacs-tricks-7-use-gnus-for-email.html][reading
e-mail in Gnus]] included this \_really\_ nifty thing that I hadn't come
across when I set up my Gnus before: *multi-pane reading*.

You know how modern news readers have a folder pane, a summary pane
 and a preview pane?

Well, you can have that too.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (gnus-add-configuration
     '(article
       (horizontal 1.0
            (vertical 60 (group 1.0))
            (vertical 1.0
        (summary 0.20 point)
        (article 1.0)))))

    (gnus-add-configuration
     '(summary
       (horizontal 1.0
            (vertical 60 (group 1.0))
            (vertical 1.0 (summary 1.0 point)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is good stuff. =)
