#+TITLE: Emacs and a British voice

There's something about deep, deep cultural programming. Anything
 spoken with a British accent just sounds infinitely cool. Everyone
 uses the default voice for Asterisk and all of that -- an American
 male.

You want to install festvox-rablpc16k or festvox-rablpc8k in addition
 to all the usual things you need for emacspeak. You'll also need
 espeakf from CVS.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@espeakf.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/espeakf login
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@espeakf.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/espeakf co -P espeakf
    cd espeakf
    sudo make install
#+END_EXAMPLE

One of these lines is responsible for setting up espeakf. I just can't
 be bothered with figuring out which. ;) Probably the dtk-program line.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq dtk-program "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/servers/espeakf.pl")
    (setenv "DTK_TCL" dtk-program)
    (setenv "DTK_PROGRAM" dtk-program)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then add this to your /etc/festival.scm:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (set! voice_default 'voice_rab_diphone)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Yummy British accent goodness.
