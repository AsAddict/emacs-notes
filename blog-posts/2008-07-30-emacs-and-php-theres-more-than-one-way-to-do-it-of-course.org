#+TITLE: Emacs and PHP: There's more than one way to do it, of course

The [[http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PhpMode][PhpMode]] page on
EmacsWiki lists five options for developing PHP in Emacs. I'm currently
using the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-mode/][php-mode
maintained by Aaron Hawley]], and I'm quite happy with it. I'm curious
about the [[http://mewde.googlecode.com/files/php-mode.el][php-mode
maintained by Ahmet Usal]], though, as it has extensive templating
support and electric behavior. It seems to have abbreviations and
argument lists for every PHP function, and I might borrow the code and
convert it to a yasnippet file if I don't end up using this. I'll switch
to Ahmet Usal's php-mode today, see what it feels like, and post my
notes. Has anyone else tried both?
