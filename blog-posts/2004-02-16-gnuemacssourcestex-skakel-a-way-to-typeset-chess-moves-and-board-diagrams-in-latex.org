  \usepackage{skak} is a beautiful way to typeset chess
   moves and board diagrams in LaTeX. This file implements
   a special editing mode for such documents ontop of the
   AUC TeX and chess.el packages. Both packages are very
   flexible and extensible. This file can be considered glue
   code to unify the power of both packages.
