  GTD Tiddly Wiki is a GettingThingsDone adaptation of JeremyRuston's
   Open Source TiddlyWiki. The purpose of GTD Tiddly Wiki is to give
   users a single repository for their GTD lists and support materials
  so
   they can create/edit lists, and then print directly to 3×5 cards for
   use with the HipsterPDA.
