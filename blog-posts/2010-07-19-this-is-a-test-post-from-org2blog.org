#+TITLE: This is a test post from org2blog

After I moved from Emacs Planner to Org-mode, I missed the ability to
quickly publish my notes from my personal information manager. A
[[http://punchagan.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/im-back/][backlink on my
blog]] led me to punchagan's
[[http://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]], which I'm using to
create this test post.

I'd like to eventually be able to publish subtrees instead of starting
new posts or publishing the entire page. This is a pretty good start,
though.
