<p>
Hi! This is a guide to help you pick up the basics of reading
customization code for Emacs - little snippets of Emacs Lisp that you
can add to your <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> to change how Emacs works. I hope
this will help you learn how to borrow interesting snippets from
README files and other people's configs so that you can tweak Emacs to
fit the way you work. This is not a detailed guide on how to
understand Emacs internals, but by the time you find yourself digging
through comint.el to figure out what's going on with command
interpretation, you probably already know your way around.
</p>

<p>
We'll assume that you already have Emacs installed and that you've
gone through the built-in tutorial (<b>Help - Emacs Tutorial</b>, <code>&lt;f1&gt; t</code>,
<code>C-h t</code>, or <code>M-x help-with-tutorial</code>). I'll also assume you have a
little programming background or can deal with the concepts of
variables and functions. Feel free to ask questions if you get stuck
on something or if you want to clarify your understanding.
</p>

<p>
Please e-mail questions, comments, and suggestions to
<a href="mailto:sacha@sachachua.com">sacha@sachachua.com</a>. I want to make this guide better, and I'd love to
hear from you. If you would like to help improve this guide, you can

Some conventions we'll use:

<h2 id="sec-2">The wonderful world of Emacs customization</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
To make the most of Emacs, learn how to read and write Emacs Lisp.
Most of Emacs is written in Emacs Lisp: the packages that add extra
functionality, the configuration code to set different options. You
can change large parts of how Emacs behaves even without restarting
Emacs.
</p>

<p>
Remember: with great power comes lots of time debugging if you mess
things up. This is a guide to help you avoid messing up, so you can
build the confidence to learn more. It's worth it. Start with one-line
in ten years (or three, or twenty, or next month - all up to you),
you'll be able to tweak Emacs to do more things than other people
might imagine a text editor can do.
</p>

<p>
This is what Emacs Lisp code looks like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(message <span class="org-string">"Hello world!"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Or something slightly more useful:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq delete-old-versions -1)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you want to start playing around with Emacs Lisp code right away, jump ahead to the section on <a href="#try">"How can I try Emacs Lisp code?"</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">"Why do I have to learn Emacs Lisp in order to get Emacs to do what I want? Shouldn't Emacs just come with reasonable defaults?"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Reasonable defaults make sense for specific people. Other people might
have completely different ideas for how they want a tool to work.
Many people use Emacs and have (occasionally quite strong)
opinions about how they want it to work. It's difficult to change the defaults for everyone<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, and since Emacs is so customizable, people tend to just fix things for themselves. If you learn how to read and write Emacs Lisp, you can pick up tips from other people's configurations and ask people for help.
</p>

<p>
There are some initiatives to put together common settings or "starter
kits" that people may like. You can check them out for inspiration or
use them as a starting point. Here are a few popular ones:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults">https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can read them to pick up ideas for customizing Emacs, or you can
use them as a starting point for your own configuration. Note that
starter kits change the behaviour of Emacs from what you might expect
based on manuals and webpages. If you've added configuration code that
you don't understand, be sure to mention it when asking for help,
since people might otherwise assume you're starting with the defaults.
It may be a good idea to look at starter kits and other people's
configuration for inspiration, but add snippets slowly instead of
copying things wholesale.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">"If I customize my Emacs, I'll have a hard time working with other people or on other computers."</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
I find that optimizing my Emacs configuration for my happiness is
worth the mild annoyance of not having my shortcuts handy (or worse,
not having Emacs!) when I pair-program with other people. If you're
pair-programming with other people, you can switch your configuration
or use a different editor. <code>emacs -q</code> starts Emacs without your
personal configuration. It's good to be familiar with other editors
like Vi so that you can be productive even if that's all you have, and
then learn how to make the most of Emacs so that you can reap the
benefits over the decades.
</p>

<p>
Many people synchronize their configuration across multiple computers
by using version control systems like Git or file synchronization
tools like Dropbox. You can set up Emacs to check for hostname or
other system variables before loading system-specific configuration.
</p>

<p>
You might think it's not worth customizing Emacs if you spend most of
your time ssh-ed into other servers. With Emacs, you can use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/">TRAMP</a> to
edit files through SSH and sudo in your local Emacs.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">"I don't have the time to fiddle around with this."</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Emacs Lisp code can help you save time by automating repetitive
actions, smoothening rough edges, or enabling time-saving features
like autocompletion. Investing some time can help you save a lot of
time later. Learning from other Emacs users can help you figure out
customizations that take little time for big results.
</p>

<p>
That said, it's a good idea to take a step back and figure out if what
you're trying to customize is really worth it. One of the occupational
hazards of using Emacs is that tweaking your Emacs configuration can
be fun, almost addictive. If you catch yourself spending four hours
fiddling with something minor, it might be time to put that aside and
focus on getting stuff done first.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>

Do you already have some Emacs Lisp code that you want to understand?
Jump ahead to the section on <a href="#understanding-lisp">"How can I understand what Emacs Lisp code does?"</a>. It's easier to learn how to read Emacs Lisp when you start
with simple examples that will help you use Emacs more effectively.
Here are some useful sources:

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-1">Emacs documentation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Manuals and FAQs for Emacs-related tools often include code snippets. For example, the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/efaq.html">Emacs FAQ</a> has an entry like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
5.47 How can I tell Emacs to fill paragraphs with a single space after each period?
===================================================================================

Add the following line to your `.emacs' file:

     (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)
</pre>

<p>
You can read the Emacs manual by typing <code>F1 i</code> (<code>info</code>) and choosing
the <b>Emacs</b> item. You can also find the Emacs Manual at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html</a> .

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">Packages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Emacs has lots of packages in different repositories, many of which
require a little extra code in order to be used to full effect. You
can use <code>M-x package-list-packages</code> to list the packages that Emacs
knows about by default. You will need an Internet connection for
that.
</p>

<p>
If you're new to Emacs, try getting used to Emacs without packages
first. There's plenty of functionality already built in. When you come
across a gap, chances are that someone has written a package to make
Emacs behave the way you want it to. Since there are lots of packages
that do similar things, you might want to look for recommendations or
ask people which ones you should start with.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the default package repository, there are other
community-supported repositories. See <a href="#installing-packages">Installing packages</a> if you would
like to install a package from a different repository.
</p>

<p>
If you install a package, check out the README, description,
documentation, or source code comments for interesting packages to
find suggested code to add to your Emacs configuration.
</p>

<p>
Here are some packages that might be interesting:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>company: adds text completion
</li>
<li>yasnippet: snippets and templates
</li>
<li>undo-tree: visualize your undo/redo history
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You will need to be connected to the Internet in order to view and
install packages. You can use <code>M-x package-list-packages</code> to show the
available packages and read the descriptions for the packages above.

<h3 id="sec-3-3">Webpages, blog posts, and the Emacs Wiki</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
While searching for information related to Emacs, you'll probably come across lots of Emacs Lisp snippets. The <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/">EmacsWiki</a> has lots of code, too. Since this is a community-maintained wiki, you may come across code that is out of date or that refers to packages that you don't have. I've included common errors in this guide to help you figure things out - see <a href="#errors">"Oh no! I have an error!"</a>

<h3 id="sec-3-4">Mailing lists, newsgroups, and Q&amp;A sites</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
There are many places where you can ask for help with Emacs. gnu.emacs.help is available as a <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs">mailing list</a> or as a newsgroup - check your favourite Usenet server or use <a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.help">Gmane</a>. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/emacs">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com/Emacs">Quora</a> are popular as well. If you ask questions there, you might get answers in the form of Emacs Lisp code. You'll also come across Emacs Lisp code while searching for answers.

After this section, you should be able to

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>try Emacs Lisp code before saving it to your configuration (that way, you don't have to keep restarting Emacs)
</li>
<li>add code to your configuration so that it runs whenever Emacs starts
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>
It's easier to understand code if you can experiment with it. There are several ways you can try Emacs Lisp code before saving it in your configuration.
</p>

<p>
Note: As you experiment with Emacs Lisp, you might run into errors. Check out <a href="http://emacslife.com/how-to-read-emacs-lisp.html#errors">"Oh no! I have an error!"</a> (<a href="http://emacslife.com/how-to-read-emacs-lisp.html#errors">http://emacslife.com/how-to-read-emacs-lisp.html#errors</a>) for some common errors and what to do about them.
</p>

<p>
Here are some ways you can run Emacs Lisp code. I'll explain them in more detail below.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>M-x ielm</code> (Inferior Emacs Lisp Mode)
</li>
<li>The <code>*scratch*</code> buffer and Emacs Lisp files
</li>
<li><code>M-:</code> (<code>eval-expression</code>)
</li>
<li><code>C-x C-e</code> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>)
</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p>
Some conventions we'll use:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Inline code will be <code>green and monospace</code> in the HTML version and generally surrounded by <code>equal signs</code> in Org Mode 
</li>
<li>Code samples will be monospace and in boxes in the HTML version, and enclosed in <code>#+begin_src</code> &#x2026; <code>#+end_src</code> in plain text. Example:
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(message <span class="org-string">"Hello world"</span>)
</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">M-x ielm (Inferior Emacs Lisp Mode)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
The Inferior Emacs Lisp Mode gives you a prompt where you can type or paste in Emacs Lisp code. Start it with <code>M-x ielm</code>. Press <code>RET</code> after you enter code, and the results will be displayed. "Inferior" is a technical term referring to how it's run, not a comment on the simplicity of the tool or the code you want to try. You can go to previously-executed code, change things, and press <code>RET</code> to run (or "evaluate") it again.
</p>

<p>
If you're copying or typing code, make sure your parentheses are all matched - every "<code>(</code>" should have a "<code>)</code>". IELM won't run the code unless it sees the closing parenthesis. So the following code is incomplete:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(message <span class="org-string">"Hello</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
but this will work:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(message <span class="org-string">"Hello world"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Tip: When you're trying out an unfamiliar mode, use <code>F1 m</code> (<code>describe-mode</code>) to learn more about the commands that are available in that mode.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">The <code>*scratch*</code> buffer and Emacs Lisp <code>.el</code> files</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
When Emacs starts, it creates a buffer called <code>*scratch*</code> with the following contents:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="org-comment">This buffer is for notes you don't want to save, and for Lisp evaluation.</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="org-comment">If you want to create a file, visit that file with C-x C-f,</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="org-comment">then enter the text in that file's own buffer.</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can add code to the end.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="org-comment">This buffer is for notes you don't want to save, and for Lisp evaluation.</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="org-comment">If you want to create a file, visit that file with C-x C-f,</span>
<span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="org-comment">then enter the text in that file's own buffer.</span>

(message <span class="org-string">"Hello world"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note: <code>;</code> is the comment character. Anything after the comment character is considered part of the comment. Make sure you add your code on a new line, not in the comment.
</p>

<p>
To run code ("evaluate" it, in Emacs terms), you can use the following commands based on what you want to run:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>M-x eval-buffer</code> runs all the code in the current file or buffer.
</li>
<li><code>M-x eval-region</code> runs the selected code. You can select code by using the mouse or by typing <code>C-SPC</code> to mark the start of the region and moving to the next.
</li>
<li><code>C-x C-e</code> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>) runs the expression (S-expression, or sexp) before the cursor. NOTE: Your cursor should be after the closing parenthesis, not on it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the <code>*scratch*</code> buffer, you can also press <code>C-j</code> (<code>eval-print-last-sexp</code>) after an expression in order to evaluate it and display the results in the buffer.
</p>

<p>
The <code>*scratch*</code> buffer is not automatically saved. If you would like to save your code for future use, you can create a file with an <code>.el</code> ending. <code>el</code> stands for Emacs Lisp, and Emacs will open these files in Emacs Lisp mode. The commands listed above work in Emacs Lisp files.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3">M-: (eval-expression)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
If you want to quickly try an expression, you can use <code>M-:</code> (<code>eval-expression</code>). To see any results it displayed, you can switch to the <code>*Messages*</code> buffer.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-4">C-x C-e (eval-last-sexp)</h3>

<p>
<code>C-x C-e</code> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>) runs the expression (S-expression, or sexp) before the cursor. NOTE: Your cursor should be after the closing parenthesis, not on it. <code>C-x C-e</code> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>) works in lots of buffers, not just in Emacs Lisp ones. You can use it to quickly try expressions while reading manual pages or other documentation.

</p>

<p>
Note: The Emacs configuration file used to be <code>~/.emacs</code>, and most webpages refer to that. <code>~/.emacs</code> still works - in fact, if you have that, it may stop Emacs from loading <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>. On the other hand, if you use <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> (and move your <code>~/.emacs</code> code to that file instead), then you have one less hidden file in your home directory (<code>~</code>). If you're adding code to your config and it's not getting loaded, make sure you have either <code>~/.emacs</code> or <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>, but not both.
</p>

<p>
When you're starting out, it's a good idea to keep your configuration in one file. Later on, you can split it up into multiple files if you want.

<p>
In math, operators like + and * go between the numbers they will work on.
In Emacs Lisp, the operator (or the "function") is at the start of the expression, followed by the things it's going to operate on ("arguments").
</p>

<p>
Here's how to calculate (1 + 2) * 3 in Emacs Lisp. Note that the multiplication is surrounded by parentheses, even if we usually leave out the parentheses in math. That's because in Emacs Lisp, all function calls have their own set of parentheses.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(* (+ 1 2) 3)
</pre>

<p>
Let's take a closer look:
</p>

<pre class="example">
( ( 1 + 2 ) * 3 )    Math expression
( * ( + 1 2 ) 3 )    Emacs Lisp expression
</pre>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/math-to-emacs-lisp.png" alt="math-to-emacs-lisp.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
See how the operators are at the beginning of whatever they're working
on, and the parentheses enclose everything that's related to that
operator? 
</p>

<p>
Understanding this will let you read code like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-hl-line-mode)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This calls the <code>global-hl-line-mode</code> function, which highlights the
current line.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(show-paren-mode)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This calls the <code>show-paren-mode</code> function, which shows matching
parentheses when your cursor is after them.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(blink-cursor-mode -1)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This calls the <code>blink-cursor-mode</code> function with <code>-1</code> as the argument,
which turns blinking cursors off.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(find-file <span class="org-string">"~/todo.org"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This calls the <code>find-file</code> function with <code>todo.org</code> file in your home
directory. It opens the file, creating it if it doesn't exist yet.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(turn-on-eldoc-mode)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This turns on <code>eldoc-mode</code>, which displays the argument list for the
current function. You can move your point around to see documentation
for other functions.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq visible-bell t)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This turns off beeping. Instead, when Emacs runs into an error, it
will flash the title bar or screen.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq column-number-mode t)

</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)

This turns on <code>eldoc-mode</code> when a buffer is switched to Emacs Lisp

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
The symbol after <code>(</code> is usually a function name, unless it's part of a
list. You'll learn how to recognize lists later. 
</p>

<p>
To find out if something is a function, what it does, what arguments
it takes, and if it has any keyboard shortcuts, use the <code>&lt;f1&gt; f</code>
(<code>describe-function</code>) command. Give it the function name. For example,
<code>&lt;f1&gt; f add-hook</code> will show you the documentation for <code>add-hook</code>, and
<code>&lt;f1&gt; f show-paren-mode</code> will show you the documentation for that.
</p>

<p>
The documentation for <code>show-paren-mode</code> starts with "show-paren-mode
is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function". Interactive functions can
be called with <code>M-x</code>. Read the description of the function to learn
more about arguments that you can pass to change its behavior. If it
mentions a prefix argument, that means that you can change its
behaviour by typing <code>C-u</code> before you call the function.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise:</b>

<p>
Use <code>&lt;f1&gt; f</code> (<code>describe-function</code>) to learn more about the following functions:

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-3">"How can I learn more about variables?"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
Variables are containers that can hold different values. In Emacs
Lisp, you can change the value of a variable as many times as you
want, and you can change it to different types of data as needed.
</p>

<p>
Like the way you can use <code>&lt;f1&gt; f</code> (<code>describe-function</code>) to learn more
about a function, you can use <code>&lt;f1&gt; v</code> (<code>describe-variable</code>) to learn
more about a variable by name. For example, use <code>&lt;f1&gt; v</code> to look up
<code>visible-bell</code>.
</p>

<p>
To make it easier for you to customize Emacs without writing Emacs
Lisp code, many variables give you an interface for setting the
variable. If you use <code>describe-variable</code> to look up the definition,
you'll often see a line like "You can <b>customize</b> this variable."
Click on the <b>customize</b> link in the documentation or move your point
to it and press RET. You can change the value there and try it
temporarily, or you can save it to your configuration. The Customize
interface is good for exploring, but because the code that it
generates can difficult to read or share, many people skip it and use
Emacs Lisp code instead.

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-4">Some things are taken literally</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
<a id="quoting"></a>
</p>

<p>
One of the examples from the section on <i>functions</i> was this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>add-hook</code> is a function. '<code>emacs-lisp-mode-hook</code> and '<code>turn-on-eldoc-mode</code> are symbols. <code>emacs-lisp-mode-hook</code> is a variable that contains a list of functions to run, and <code>turn-on-eldoc-mode</code> is a function that we're adding to that list.
</p>

<p>
The single quote means take it literally - treat it as the name of something. If you remove the quote from <code>emacs-lisp-mode-hook</code>, Emacs will look up the value in that variable and use that as the name of the variable to actually set, and you'll probably get an error.
</p>

<p>
Here's another example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This calls the <code>fset</code> function, which sets the function definition of <code>yes-or-no-p</code> to the function <code>y-or-n-p</code>. In short, it changes the "yes" or "no" prompts to "y" or "n", which can be convenient.
</p>

<p>
Not everything is quoted. You'll often see lines like this in Emacs configuration files:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq delete-old-versions -1)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<code>setq</code> stands for "set quoted". This is actually the same code as <code>(set 'delete-old-versions -1)</code> or <code>(set (quote delete-old-versions) -1)</code>, but 
<code>setq</code> is shorter, so it's more common.
</p>

<p>
This can be confusing. When you're starting out, copy code carefully. If there's a single quote, make sure there's a single quote in your copy. If there isn't, skip it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-5">Lists and lists and lists of lists</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-5">
<p>
You can set the value of a variable to multiple things. In Emacs configuration files, you'll often see ' used for lists. For example,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq diff-switches '(<span class="org-string">"-b"</span> <span class="org-string">"-u"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
sets the options for the <code>diff</code> command to a list containing two items, <code>-b</code> and <code>-u</code>. Quoting the list creates a list and quotes all the content in it as needed. You can create lists with the <code>list</code> function instead. The code above is the same as:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq diff-switches (list <span class="org-string">"-b"</span> <span class="org-string">"-u"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The code above sets the value of the variable to a list, ignoring any previous values it had. 
</p>

<p>
<a id="load-path"></a>
Most of the time, though, you want to add to a list instead of
completely replacing it. You'll often see something like this in
people's configuration files:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list 'load-path <span class="org-string">"~/elisp"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This adds the <code>~/elisp</code> directory to the beginning of the list of directories that Emacs checks when loading libraries. If the directory is already in the list, <code>add-to-list</code> does nothing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="package-archives"></a>
Some lists use the dot notation. This depends on what's expected by the function that uses the list. For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list 'package-archives '(<span class="org-string">"melpa"</span> . <span class="org-string">"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This calls the <code>add-to-list</code> function with two arguments. The first argument ('<code>package-archives</code>) specifies the list to add an item to, and the second argument ('<code>("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")</code>) is the data to add. The dot notation <code>(a . b)</code> shows that this is a <b>cons cell</b>, which always has two parts: the <b>car</b> and the <b>cdr</b>. To understand the difference between cons cells and other lists, you need to know how lists are constructed.
</p>

<p>
A cons cell looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
       car              cdr
+----------------+----------------+
|                |                |
|       a        |       b        |
|                |                |
+----------------+----------------+
</pre>

<p>
A list like '<code>("-b" "-u")</code> is made up of several cons cells.
</p>

<pre class="example">
       car              cdr                         car             cdr
+----------------+----------------+         +----------------+----------------+
|                |                |         |                |                |
|      -b        |       ------------------&gt;|       -u       |                |
|                |                |         |                |                |
+----------------+----------------+         +----------------+----------------+
</pre>

<p>
In Emacs Lisp, '<code>("-b" "-u")</code> is equivalent to <code>(cons "-b" (cons "-u" nil))</code>, and it's not the same as <code>(cons "-b" "-u")</code>. That's why you have to be careful about whether something uses dots or not. A good way to find out is by reading other people's configuration and seeing how they use that variable.
</p>

<p>
Because lists are made up of cons cells, you'll sometimes see people add to lists like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq load-path (cons <span class="org-string">"~/elisp"</span> load-path))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This adds <code>~/elisp</code> to the beginning of the <code>load-path</code> list. It does this by using <code>cons</code> to create a new cons cell that has <code>~/elisp</code> at the beginning and a pointer to the rest of the values in <code>load-path</code>, and then storing that in <code>load-path</code>.
</p>

<p>
Lists can also contain lists. For example, here's some code that saves backup files (the ones that end in <code>~</code>) to <code>~/.emacs.d/backups</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq backup-directory-alist '((<span class="org-string">"."</span> . <span class="org-string">"~/.emacs.d/backups"</span>)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is how the second argument breaks down:
</p>

<pre class="example">
( ;; a list with one item
 ("." . "~/.emacs.d/backups") ;; a cons cell with a car of "." and a cdr of "~/.emacs.d/backups"
)
</pre>

<p>
If you want to learn more about cons cells, see the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Box-Diagrams.html#Box-Diagrams">Emacs Lisp Reference</a>.
</p>

<p>
Advanced: Backquotes or backticks (<code>`</code>) are special. They quote the expression that follows them, but they also allow you to substitute values or evaluate expressions. Backquotes are useful for more complex structures or when you're working with macros. They do basically the same thing as ' for lists, but anything preceded by a comma (,) is evaluated. They're less common, but if you do come across them, note that <code>`</code> is not the same as '. See the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Backquote.html">Emacs Lisp Reference</a> for more information.

<h3 id="sec-5-6">Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-6">
<p>
The default keyboard shortcuts (or "keybindings") can be difficult to
remember, and many useful functions don't have any keyboard shortcuts
at all. People often reassign keys to other functions in their
configuration files. There are different ways to assign keys depending
on where you want the keybinding to be available.

<h4 id="sec-5-6-1">Setting keybindings in all buffers</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-6-1">
<p>
You can assign a key to a function globally, which means that it will be available if there are no mode maps or local keybindings that override it. Mode maps are set by major modes like <code>emacs-lisp-mode</code> or minor modes like <code>auto-fill-mode</code>. This is usually done with <code>global-set-key</code>, although sometimes you'll see it done with <code>define-key</code> and <code>global-map</code>. 
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"RET"</span>) 'newline-and-indent)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This redefines the Return key (or the Enter key) so that it calls the <code>newline-and-indent</code> function by default. 
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"C-+"</span>) 'text-scale-increase)
(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"C--"</span>) 'text-scale-decrease)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
These set <code>C-+</code> (<code>Ctrl</code> and <code>&lt;plus&gt;</code>) and <code>C--</code> (<code>Ctrl</code> and <code>&lt;minus&gt;</code>) to increase and decrease the font size.

<h4 id="sec-5-6-2">What does <code>kbd</code> do? How can I figure out which key it sets?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-6-2">
<p>
If you've gone through the Emacs Tutorial (<b>Help - Emacs Tutorial</b> or <code>F1 t</code>), you'll be familiar with many of the conventions used for writing keyboard shortcuts. <code>C-</code> stands for the <code>Ctrl</code> key, <code>M-</code> stands for the <code>Meta</code> key (which is probably <code>Alt</code> or <code>Option</code> on your keyboard). There are other prefixes as well. <code>S-</code> is for Shift, <code>H-</code> is for <code>Hyper</code>, and <code>s-</code> is for <code>Super</code>. Some people use operating system tools (such as <code>setxkbmap</code> for Linux) to change keys on their keyboard to <code>Super</code> or <code>Hyper</code> in order to enable even more keyboard shortcuts.
</p>

<p>
Uppercase or lowercase depends on the character in the shortcut. <code>C-x</code> means <code>Control</code> + <code>x</code>, while <code>C-X</code> is actually <code>Control</code> + <code>Shift</code> + <code>X</code>. You can also specify shift by adding <code>S-</code>, so <code>C-X</code> and <code>C-S-x</code> are the same.
</p>

<p>
In addition, there are some special characters: <code>RET</code>, <code>SPC</code>, <code>TAB</code>, and <code>ESC</code> must be written in uppercase to mean the special keys they refer to. (There's also <code>LFD</code> and <code>NUL</code>, but you're probably not going to encounter those as often.) You can use angle brackets to refer to some other keys, like <code>&lt;return&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;up&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;down&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;left&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;right&gt;</code>. Function keys are written like this: <code>&lt;f1&gt;</code>. 
</p>

<p>
There are different ways to specify the key. Many people use <code>(kbd ...)</code> because it makes bindings easy to read.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"M-/"</span>) 'hippie-expand)
</pre>

This is the same as 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-set-key [?\M-/] 'hippie-expand)

<p>
You can use <code>^</code> to mean <code>Control</code>, so

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"C-s"</span>) 'isearch-forward-regexp)

</pre>
</div>
<p>
but <code>C-</code> is probably easier to read.
</p>

<p>
When using <code>kbd</code>, whitespace doesn't usually matter, but it's easier to read if you use space to separate the keys to type. For more information about the syntax used by <code>kbd</code>, see <code>F1 f</code> (<code>describe-function</code>) for <code>kbd</code>, then follow the link to the documentation for <code>edmacro-mode</code>.

<h4 id="sec-5-6-3">Multi-key shortcuts</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-6-3">
<p>
You can set up keybindings that use more than one key combination. This is a popular technique since you can only have so many short keybindings. For example, the following code changes <code>C-x C-b</code> to call <code>ibuffer</code>.

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
You don't have to start with <code>C-c</code> or <code>C-x</code>. Consider using one of your function keys like <code>&lt;f9&gt;</code> as the start of your keyboard shortcuts. Then you can create shortcuts that don't involve using <code>Ctrl</code>, <code>Alt</code>, or other modifier keys.
</p>

That is, if you want <code>M-t l</code> to call <code>transpose-lines</code>, you'll need to get rid of <code>M-t</code>'s default binding to <code>transpose-words</code> first. To unset a key, bind it to <code>nil</code>. Here's an example that also includes a few handy shortcuts:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"M-t"</span>) nil) <span class="org-comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="org-comment">Remove the old keybinding</span>
(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"M-t l"</span>) 'transpose-lines)
(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"M-t w"</span>) 'transpose-words)
(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"M-t t"</span>) 'transpose-words)
(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"M-t M-t"</span>) 'transpose-words)
(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"M-t s"</span>) 'transpose-sexps)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The example above has three bindings for <code>transpose-words</code>. <code>M-t w</code> uses the mnemonic of *t*ranspose *w*ords. <code>M-t t</code> is similar to the original binding for <code>transpose-words</code>, which was <code>M-t</code>. <code>M-t M-t</code> just makes it a little easier. This may seem like overkill, but sometimes you'll find it easier to hold the <code>Meta</code> key down and hit <code>t</code> twice quickly instead of typing <code>M-t</code>, releasing <code>Meta</code>, and then typing <code>t</code>. As you read other people's keybindings, you'll get a sense of how people have configured their keyboard shortcuts to speed up typing and minimize thinking.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-6-5">
<p>
<a id="mode-keys"></a>
</p>

<p>
Sometimes you want keys to do different things in different types of
files. Modes are how Emacs changes behaviour based on context. For
example, Java files use java-mode, Org files use org-mode, and so
forth. Each mode has a keybinding map (or a "keymap"). You can assign
a key in a mode map, which means it will override global keybindings
in buffers with that mode. You can do this with <code>define-key</code> if you
know the name of the keymap you want to change, which is generally the
name of the mode + <code>-map</code>. For example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(define-key c-mode-map (kbd <span class="org-string">"C-c o"</span>) 'ff-find-other-file)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
changes the <code>C-c o</code> keyboard shortcut to <code>ff-find-other-file</code>, but only in C buffers.
</p>

<p>
Note that if you use <code>define-key</code> with a mode map, the mode must already be loaded by the time this code is run. That's why you'll often see this after a <code>require</code> (which loads the code) or inside an <code>eval-after-load</code> (which postpones the code until after the mode is loaded). See <a href="#load">Adding more features to Emacs</a> for more information.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-6-6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-5-6-6">Other ways people bind keys</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-6-6">
<p>
The <code>bind-key</code> package provides a function that makes it easier to see your personal keybindings, but <code>bind-key</code> is not part of Emacs by default. I use <code>bind-key</code> a lot in <a href="http://sachachua.com/dotemacs">my configuration</a>. The syntax is similar to <code>global-set-key</code>, except it automatically wraps the keyboard shortcut string in <code>kbd</code>. It also keeps track of which keyboard shortcuts you've overridden so that you can use <code>M-x describe-personal-keybindings</code> to review them.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(bind-key <span class="org-string">"C-+"</span> 'text-scale-increase)
(bind-key <span class="org-string">"C--"</span> 'text-scale-decrease)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You'll need to install and use the <code>bind-key</code> package before you can use that code.
</p>

<p>
Because keybinding is something that lots of people do to customize their Emacs, you may find other ways that people have simplified writing keybindings for themselves. When in doubt, use <code>F1 f</code> (<code>describe-function</code>) to explore how something works. If the function can't be found, see if it's in a package somewhere, or search the Web for more information.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-7">Defuns - function definitions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-7">
<p>
In addition to the functions built into Emacs or available in
packages, many people define their own with the <code>defun</code> function.
</p>

<p>
People often distinguish custom functions by starting them with <code>my/</code>
or their initials. This makes it easier to tell which functions
they've customized and which ones are part of a package. You can
change the name of a function as long as you make sure you change the
name wherever it's called, such as in keyboard shortcuts, hooks, or
other functions.
</p>

<p>
For example, here's a custom function from <a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/Config/blob/master/emacs.el#L184">Jorgan Schaefer's config</a>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">fc/kill-to-beginning-of-line</span> ()
  <span class="org-doc">"Kill from the beginning of the line to point."</span>
  (interactive)
  (kill-region (point-at-bol) (point)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This creates a function called <code>fc/kill-to-beginning-of-line</code>. <code>()</code> is
the argument list. Since it doesn't contain anything, that means this
function does not take arguments. "<code>Kill from the beginning of the
line to point.</code>" is a documentation string (or docstring) that
describes what the function does. Docstrings are optional, but highly
recommended. <code>(interactive)</code> means that this can be called with <code>M-x</code> (<code>execute-extended-command</code>)
or bound to a keyboard shortcut.
</p>

<p>
If a function does not have the <code>(interactive)</code> keyword, you won't be
able to call it with <code>M-x</code> or assign it to a keyboard shortcut, but
you will still be able to write Emacs Lisp code that calls the
function. This means <code>M-x</code> (<code>execute-extended-command</code>) lists only the
commands that people will probably find useful while working directly
with Emacs, skipping internal functions used by code.
</p>

<p>
Once you've defined a custom function, you can bind it to a keyboard
shortcut if you want. The code below binds the
<code>fc/kill-to-beginning-of-line</code> function to <code>C-c C-u</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"C-c C-u"</span>) 'fc/kill-to-beginning-of-line)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-8">Lambdas - anonymous functions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-8">
<p>
Sometimes people just want to create a keyboard binding or process
some data without defining a new function. <code>lambda</code> creates an
anonymous function. Here's an example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-set-key (kbd <span class="org-string">"C-c E"</span>) (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> () (interactive) (find-file <span class="org-string">"~/.emacs.d/init.el"</span>)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This binds <code>C-c E</code> to an anonymous function. The <code>()</code> means it doesn't
take any arguments. <code>(interactive)</code> means it can be called through a
keyboard shortcut, although since it's anonymous, it can't be called
with <code>M-x</code>. The function opens the <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> file, which is
a handy way to edit your configuration.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
<a id="load"></a>
</p>

<p>
Most Emacs libraries are not loaded automatically. This saves memory
and keeps things simpler. You can load built-in code by using
<code>require</code>, like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">require</span> '<span class="org-constant">hl-line</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This loads the <code>hl-line</code> library. <code>require</code> looks for a file named
after the name provided to it, loads it, and double-checks that the
library includes <code>(provide 'feature-name-goes-here)</code>. It throws an
error if the library is not found or if it doesn't provide that
symbol.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-1">Installing packages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
<a id="installing-packages"></a>
</p>

<p>
Emacs comes with a lot of code, but there are even more packages out
there. When you read other people's Emacs configurations, you might
come across other interesting packages to try out.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes people don't indicate which packages they use, so you have
to guess the package name based on the function. For example,
<code>(global-auto-complete-mode)</code> turns on a completion mode called
<code>auto-complete-mode</code> in all buffers. Before you can use this, you will
need to install the <code>auto-complete</code> buffer. In general, you can find
package names by looking at functions that include <code>mode</code> in their
name, removing <code>global</code>, <code>turn-on</code>, and other prefixes as needed.
</p>

<p>
The default package repository in Emacs 24 has a limited number of
packages. For more choices, you may want to add another repository
such as <a href="http://melpa.milkbox.net">MELPA</a> or <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/">Marmalade</a> Here's the code that you would run in order
to add these repositories to your Emacs:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">require</span> '<span class="org-constant">package</span>)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
  '(<span class="org-string">"melpa"</span> . <span class="org-string">"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"</span>))
(add-to-list 'package-archives 
  '(<span class="org-string">"marmalade"</span> . <span class="org-string">"http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you're connected to the Internet, use <code>M-x package-refresh-contents</code>
to update the list of packages. Use <code>M-x package-list-packages</code> to list
the available packages. <code>i</code> marks the current package for installation,
and <code>x</code> actually performs the operations.
</p>

<p>
Installed packages aren't automatically loaded, although a lightweight
list of the functions they define is loaded after your <code>init.el</code> is
run. You can start that initialization earlier by adding
<code>(package-initialize)</code>. If this still doesn't get your code to work,
use <code>(require 'feature-name)</code>, where the feature name is usually the
name of the package. See <a href="#void-function">Lisp error: (void-function &#x2026;)</a> or <a href="#void-variable">Symbol's
value as variable is void: <span class="underline">_</span></a> for some more details.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes people want to install some packages on one computer but not
on another. Here's example code that runs some configuration if the
<code>helm</code> package can be loaded, but silently continues if the package
has not been installed.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">when</span> (<span class="org-keyword">require</span> '<span class="org-constant">helm-config</span> nil t)
   (setq helm-quick-update t)
   (helm-mode))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you use <code>F1 f</code> (<code>describe-function</code>) on <code>require</code>, you'll see that
it has one required argument (feature) and two optional arguments
(filename, noerror). <code>require</code> returns non-nil (or true) if the
library was loaded, so if the library exists, then the rest of the
code inside the <code>when</code> expression gets called.
</p>

<p>
Along those lines, you may come across code that looks like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">eval-after-load</span> <span class="org-string">"dash"</span> 
  '(dash-enable-font-lock))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This runs <code>(dash-enable-font-lock)</code> only after <code>dash</code> is loaded. It
does not automatically load <code>dash</code>. You'll see this when people have
configuration that they want to run only if something is loaded, which
can make sense for performance reasons.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-2">Other Emacs Lisp files</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">
<p>
<a id="unpackaged"></a>
</p>

<p>
Some files are not yet available as packages. If you search for the
function, you'll probably find a webpage with an <code>.el</code> file. You can
save those to your computer and load them with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(load <span class="org-string">"/path/to/file.el"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can also use the <code>require</code> syntax, but first you'll need to add your downloaded Emacs Lisp file to the <code>load-path</code> with something like this.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list 'load-path <span class="org-string">"/path/to/dir/with/el/files"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then you can use <code>require</code> to load the Emacs Lisp code if it exists. See <a href="#load">Adding more features to Emacs</a> for details.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">require</span> '<span class="org-constant">feature-name</span>)

<a id="errors"></a>
</p>

<p>
Part of learning a new language is learning how to recognize and deal
with different errors. 
</p>

<p>
If you've already added the code to your <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>, you can
start Emacs with <code>emacs --debug-init</code> to display debugging messages,
or you can start Emacs with <code>emacs -q</code> to skip your personal
configuration. Before reporting a bug with Emacs or with a package,
use <code>emacs -q</code> (or <code>emacs -Q</code>, which skips site-wide configuration as
well) to see if it works as intended without your personal
configuration.
</p>

<p>
You can narrow down the source of the problem by progressively
commenting out more and more of the code. Make sure you comment out
balanced sets of parentheses. To comment a region, select it and use
<code>M-x comment-region</code>. You can use <code>M-x uncomment-region</code> to uncomment
it. <code>M-x comment-dwim</code> (do what I mean) guesses whether you want to
comment or uncomment something, and has the handy keyboard shortcut
<code>M-;</code>.

The code is trying to get the value of a variable that has not yet been set. See if there's other code that you need to evaluate first in order to set up those variables.

You might also get this if you're using <code>C-x C-e</code> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>)

If the code you're looking at has multiple expressions, you'll need to call <code>C-x C-e</code> after each of them.
