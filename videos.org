** Emacs in 10 minutes! (zaychenok)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3_SFerNIeI

A basic introduction to one of the more popular programming editors. Yes, I know I went fast - sorry. I'll make a longer tutorial at some point. This was more of a feature-overview type style. And I only had time for the basic features.

** Short Demo of Emacs / Aquamacs (Rob Rohan)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1dKFpGwKZ4	

Short movie to show some of my favorite features of emacs and aquamacs (A Mac port of emacs). This doesn't show how to do anything specific in emacs, just a few modes and techniques that I find very helpful and unique to emacs

** Using emacs (more) efficiently (than vim). (Paul Ozog)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHshNewGrY4

I've always liked seeing other people's workflow - so maybe this video will inspire some pimple-faced German kid out there to more effectively use emacs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Mxka1ej0A

Covers C-x C-f, C-x C-s, C-x C-c, C-g (load file, save file, quit, cancel command). Meant to be a very short lesson to teach the essentials of Emacs.

** Hack Emacs

** Org
*** Hack Emacs - An Overview of Org Mode (Rick Dillon)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W82EdwQhxU

I take a high level look at Org Mode, an entire application written for Emacs that deals with data capture and organization through structural editing.

*** Emacs Org-mode - a system for note-taking and project planning (GoogleTechTalks)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM	

Org-mode is a large Emacs sub-systems that has been integrated into Emacs with the version 22.1 release. From its original intention,
Org-mode is a system for structured note-taking and project planning. It uses strictly plain text files, making it a truly portable, system-independent solution. The project-planning features are implemented using a fairly simple outlining paradigm, upon which meta-data concepts like due dates, priorities, TODO states and tags are overlayed in a non-intrusive way. Besides outlining the system and its basic concepts, I will give background information into the history of Org-mode and discuss the properties of such an evolved system compared to a top-down designed one. Finally, I will also briefly touch on some technical aspects that may be interesting for Emacs wizards and developers.

*** Emacs Power: Can your editor do THIS!	(mina86)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQAd41VAXWo	

Emacs with orgtbl mode used to create a HTML table. Creating HTML tables by hand can be painful, however thanks to orgtbl mode (which comes with org mode) Emacs users can edit tables in friendly way and later "send" (as org mode calls it) the data into a HTML source code. Inserting new columns and rearranging them is a single key binding!

** Using gdb within emacs (Aditya Bankar)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHOzMOzzxDA

This video explains how to use gdb within emacs. So you can debug your code using graphical tools instead of character commands. (This video has been made on Ubuntu
 8.04 using recordmydesktop.)
